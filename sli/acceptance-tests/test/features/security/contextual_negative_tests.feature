    Given I am logged in using "cgray" "cgray1234" to realm "IL"

    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    Given I am logged in using "stweed" "token-only-no-password" to realm "IL"
    And I navigate to GET <URI OF CONTEXT BASED ENTITY>
    Then I should receive a return code of 403
    Given I am logged in using "sbantu" "sbantu1234" to realm "IL"
    And I navigate to GET <URI OF CONTEXT BASED ENTITY>
