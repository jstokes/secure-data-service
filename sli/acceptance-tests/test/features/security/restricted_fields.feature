Feature: As an SLI application I want to restrict user's access to restricted data
  That means the user should not be able to access/deduce any information about those data

  Background:
    Given format "application/json"

  Scenario: Linda Kim querying on the restricted fields
    Given I am logged in using "linda.kim" "linda.kim1234" to realm "IL"
    When I make an API call to get "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should see that "entityType" is "student" in the JSON response
    And I should see that "economicDisadvantaged" is nil in the JSON response
    And I should see that "schoolFoodServicesEligibility" is nil in the JSON response
    Given parameter "economicDisadvantaged" is "false"
    And I make an API call to get "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 404

    And parameter "schoolFoodServicesEligibility" is "Free"
    When I make an API call to get "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    When I create request data out of the response
    And I set parameter "economicDisadvantaged" to "false"
    And I make an API call to update the student "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 403

    And the sli securityEvent collection is empty
    And I navigate to GET "/v1/sections/706ee3be-0dae-4e98-9525-f564e05aa388_id/studentSectionAssociations/students?sortBy=schoolFoodServicesEligibility"
    Then I should receive a return code of 403
    And I check to find if record is in sli db collection:
        | collectionName  | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter         | searchValue                                            | searchType |
        | securityEvent   | 1                   | body.tenantId           | Midgar                                                 | string     |

    And "1" security event with field "body.actionUri" matching "http.*/api/rest/v.*/sections/706ee3be-0dae-4e98-9525-f564e05aa388_id/studentSectionAssociations/students" should be in the sli db
    And "1" security event matching "Access Denied:Cannot search on restricted field schoolFoodServicesEligibility" should be in the sli db
