Feature: As an SLI application I want to restrict user's access to restricted data
  That means the user should not be able to access/deduce any information about those data

Background:
  Given format "application/json"

Scenario: Linda Kim querying on the restricted fields
  Given I am logged in using "linda.kim" "linda.kim1234" to realm "IL"
  When I make an API call to get "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
  Then I should receive a return code of 200
  And I should see that "entityType" is "student" in the JSON response
  Given parameter "economicDisadvantaged" is "false"
  And I make an API call to get "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
  Then I should receive a return code of 400
  Given parameter "schoolFoodServicesEligibility" is "Reduced price"
  When I make an API call to get "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
  Then I should receive a return code of 400

Scenario: Rick Rogers querying on the restricted fields
  Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
  And parameter "economicDisadvantaged" is "true"
  And parameter "schoolFoodServicesEligibility" is "Free"
  When I make an API call to get "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
  Then I should receive a return code of 200
  And I should see that "entityType" is "student" in the JSON response
  And I should see that "economicDisadvantaged" is "true" in the JSON response
  And I should see that "schoolFoodServicesEligibility" is "Free" in the JSON response

Scenario: Rick Rogers querying on the restricted fields - incorrect values
  Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
  And parameter "economicDisadvantaged" is "false"
  When I make an API call to get "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
  Then I should receive a return code of 404
  Given parameter "schoolFoodServicesEligibility" is "Reduced price"
  When I make an API call to get "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
  Then I should receive a return code of 404

Scenario: User with READ_RESTRICTED and not WRITE_RESTRICTED querying on the restricted fields
  Given I am logged in using "rrogerslimitedwrite" "rrogerslimitedwrite1234" to realm "IL"
  And parameter "economicDisadvantaged" is "true"
  And parameter "schoolFoodServicesEligibility" is "Free"
  When I make an API call to get "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
  Then I should receive a return code of 200
  And I should see that "entityType" is "student" in the JSON response
  And I should see that "economicDisadvantaged" is "true" in the JSON response
  And I should see that "schoolFoodServicesEligibility" is "Free" in the JSON response

Scenario: User with READ_RESTRICTED and not WRITE_RESTRICTED updating a restricted field
  Given I am logged in using "rrogerslimitedwrite" "rrogerslimitedwrite1234" to realm "IL"
  And parameter "economicDisadvantaged" is "true"
  And parameter "schoolFoodServicesEligibility" is "Free"
  When I make an API call to get "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
  Then I should receive a return code of 200
  When I create request data out of the response
  And I set parameter "economicDisadvantaged" to "false" 
  And I make an API call to update the student "<'MARVIN MILLER'>"
  Then I should receive a return code of 403
