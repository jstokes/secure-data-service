Feature: Context-based Permissions for Educator 

I would like to implement context-based permissions, so that when a SEA/LEA end user (that represents an Educator) access the SLI, he/she is provided with the student data that the Educator has relationship with.

#School

Given I am a valid <Realm> end user <Username> with password <Password>
And I am authenticated to SEA/LEA IDP
And I have a Role attribute that equals "Educator"
And my School is <School>
When I make an API call to get the school <School>
Then I receive a JSON response that includes the school <School> and its attributes
Examples:
