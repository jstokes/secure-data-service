Feature: Get available apps API 
 
 As a SE/LEA end user, I would like to be able to get a list of all the applications that are available to me. 

Scenario:  Authenticated SEA/LEA user requests for info on own available apps
 
Given I am logged in using "ejane" "ejane1234" to realm "IL"
When I make an API call to get my available apps
Then I receive a JSON object listing all the apps that my SEA/LEA have approved
And the object includes an app URL, admin URL, image URL, description, title, vendor, version, display method, is admin app
And none of the apps are admin apps

Scenario: Authenticated SEA/LEA user requests for info on available admin apps

Given I am logged in using "ejane" "ejane1234" to realm "IL"
When I make an API call to get my available apps filtered by admin
Then I receive a JSON object listing all the apps that my SEA/LEA have approved
And the resulting list is empty
