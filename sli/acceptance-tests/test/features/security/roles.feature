Feature: SLI Default Roles and Permissions
 
 As a SLI Super Administrator, I would like to have the possibility to map the SLI roles with those of the corresponding IDPs,
 so that only the users with existing and matching default SLI roles can access the system
 
 As an SLI Admin, I want to be able to enforce rights on the entity attribute level,
 so that  SEA/LEA end user can do CRUD on the entities stored in the data store, based on the SLI Default Role
  
Scenario Outline:  SEA/LEA user with a valid Default SLI Role making API call
 
Given  I am valid SEA/LEA end user <Username> with password <Password>
And I have a Role attribute returned from the "SEA/LEA IDP"
And the role attribute equals <AnyDefaultSLIRole>
And I am authenticated on "SEA/LEA IDP"
When I make a REST API call 
Then I get the JSON response displayed
Examples:
| Username        | Password            | AnyDefaultSLIRole  |
| "educator"      | "educator1234"      | "Educator"         |
| "aggregator"    | "aggregator1234"    | "Aggregate Viewer" |
| "administrator" | "administrator1234" | "IT Administrator" |
| "leader"        | "leader1234"        | "Leader"           |

And I have a Role attribute returned from the "SEA/LEA IDP"
And the role attribute equals "teacher"
And I am authenticated on "SEA/LEA IDP"
When I make a REST API call
Then I get response that I am not authorized to do that operation because I do not have a valid SLI Default Role

Given  I am valid SEA/LEA end user "nouser" with password "nouser1234" 
And I do not have a Role attribute returned from the "SEA/LEA IDP"

When I make a REST API call

And I am authenticated on "SEA/LEA IDP"
And the role attribute equals "IT Administrator"
And "IT Administrator" is allowed to change Student address
When I make an API call to change the Student address to "1234 Somewhere"
Then the Student address is changed

Given  I am valid SEA/LEA end user <Username> with password <Password>

And the role attribute equals <Role>
And <Role> is not allowed to change Student address
When I make an API call to change the Student address to "9876 Nowhere"
Then a message is displayed that the <Role> role does not allow this action 
Examples:
| Username   | Password       | Role       |
