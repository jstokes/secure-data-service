Feature: SLI Default Roles and Permissions
 
As a SLI Operator/Administrator, I want to login to the SLI Default Roles Admin Page,
so I could get an information about the default roles in SLI and their permissions.

 As a SLI Super Administrator, I would like to have the possibility to map the SLI roles with those of the corresponding IDPs,
 so that only the users with existing and matching default SLI roles can access the system
 
 As an SLI Admin, I want to be able to enforce rights on the entity attribute level,
 so that  SEA/LEA end user can do CRUD on the entities stored in the data store, based on the SLI Default Role
