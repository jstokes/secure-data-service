Feature: Admin delegation CRUD

  Scenario: District administrator creating admin delegation
    Given I am logged in using "sunsetadmin" "sunsetadmin1234" to realm "SLI"
    When I POST a new admin delegation
    Then I should receive a return code of 201

  Scenario: State administrator without access being denied update to application authorization
    Given the sli securityEvent collection is empty
    And I am logged in using "iladmin" "iladmin1234" to realm "SLI"
    When I do not have access to app authorizations for district "IL-SUNSET"
    Then I should update app authorizations for district "IL-SUNSET"
    And I should receive a return code of 403
    And a security event matching "^Access Denied" should be in the sli db
    And I check to find if record is in sli db collection:
     | collectionName      | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter       | searchValue                           |
     | securityEvent       | 1                   | body.userEdOrg        | fakeab32-b493-999b-a6f3-sliedorg1234  |
