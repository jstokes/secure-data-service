#TODO: This entire feature is suspect in my book; some of the stepdefs are not even valid
Feature: Entity versioning and mock migration tests
  As a system that supports versions, I want to start tracking versions of entities.

  Background: None

  @DB_MIGRATION_BEFORE_API_STARTS
  Scenario: Remove all records in the metaData collection
    Given I drop the "metaData" collection

  @DB_MIGRATION_AFTER_API_STARTS
  Scenario: Check that after starting the API, documents exist in the collection
    Then there should be 42 records in the "metaData" collection
    And "SARJE" field is "0" for all records
    And "mongo_sv" field is "1" for all records
    And "dal_sv" field is "1" for all records

  @DB_MIGRATION_AFTER_UPVERSIONING
  Scenario: Check that the updated versions were detected on startup and thus SARJE has been signaled
    Then there should be 42 records in the "metaData" collection
    And "SARJE" field is "1" for all records
    And "mongo_sv" field is "1" for all records
    And "dal_sv" field is "5" for all records

  # This test checks for mock fields added to a student
  @DB_MIGRATION_AFTER_UPVERSIONING
  Scenario: API requests for an student get transformed using the test transformation
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And format "application/vnd.slc+json"  
    When I navigate to GET "/<STAFF URI>/<'Rick Rogers' ID>"
    Then "favoriteSubject" should be "Math"
    And "sex" should not exist
    And "name" should not exist
    And "nameData" should exist

  @DB_MIGRATION_AFTER_UPVERSIONING
  Scenario: A posted entity has the correct version number after being saved to database
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And format "application/vnd.slc+json"  
    And a valid entity json document for a "educationOrganization"
    When I navigate to POST "/<EDORG URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
    And I should receive an ID for the newly created entity
    Then the entity should have a version of "5" in the database

  @DB_MIGRATION_AFTER_UPVERSIONING
  Scenario: API requests for an student get chained
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And format "application/vnd.slc+json"  
    When I navigate to GET "/<STUDENT URI>/<STUDENT ID>"
    Then "mascot" should be "pirates"
    And "favoriteColor" should be "yellow"
    And "somefield" should be "somevalue"
