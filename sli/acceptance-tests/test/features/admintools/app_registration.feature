Feature: Application Registration
  As a super-admin
  In order to allow the onboarding of new applications to SLI
  I want to be able to create new application keys

#Background:
#  Given I have an open web browser
#    And my LDAP server has been setup and running

Scenario: A district-level administrator attempts to manage applications
  Given I am a valid district-level administrator
    And I have an open browser
   When I attempt to manage applications
   Then I should not be allowed to access the page

Scenario: An operator denies a pending application
  Given I have an open browser
    And a developer has registered a new application
    And I am a valid inBloom operator
    And I am managing my applications
    And I see the pending application
   When I deny the application
   Then I no longer see the application

Scenario: An operator denies an approved application
  Given I have an open browser
    And a developer has registered a new application
    And I am a valid inBloom operator
    And I am managing my applications
    And I see the pending application
    And I approve the application
    And I see the approved application
  When I deny the application
  Then I no longer see the application

Scenario: A developer cancels creation of a new application
  Given I am a valid inBloom developer
    And I have an open browser
    And I am managing my applications
    And I want to create a new application
   When I cancel out of the new application form
   Then I am managing my applications again

Scenario: A developer does not provide required information for an application
  Given I am a valid inBloom developer
    And I have an open browser
    And I am managing my applications
   When I submit an application for registration without inputting any information
   Then I should see validation errors for:
    | Name            |
    | Description     |
    | Version         |
    | Application url |
    | Redirect uri    |

Scenario: A developer does not need to provide application and redirect URLs for an installed application
  Given I am a valid inBloom developer
  And I have an open browser
  And I am managing my applications
  When I submit an application for registration marked as "Installed"
  Then I should not see validation errors for:
    | Application url |
    | Redirect uri    |

Scenario: A developer must provide correctly formatted URLs where needed
  Given I am a valid inBloom developer
    And I have an open browser
    And I am managing my applications
   When I submit an application for registration with improperly formatted URLs
   Then I should see validation errors for:
    | Administration url |
    | Image url          |
    | Application url    |
    | Redirect uri       |
