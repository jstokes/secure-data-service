Feature: Custom Role Mapping Tool
As an SEA/LEA  Admin, I would like to have the Complex Role Mapping admin tool, so that I can map lists of SEA/LEA Directory roles to their associated SLI Access Rights.

And I got a warning message saying "Are you sure you want to reset the mappings to factory defaults? This will remove any custom defined roles!"
When I click 'OK' on the warning message
