Feature: Custom Role Mapping Tool
As an SEA/LEA  Admin, I would like to have the Complex Role Mapping admin tool, so that I can map lists of SEA/LEA Directory roles to their associated SLI Access Rights.

Background:
Given I have an open web browser
When I navigate to the Custom Role Mapping Page
And I was redirected to the "Simple" IDP Login page
When I submit the credentials "sunsetadmin" "sunsetadmin1234" for the "Simple" login page
Then I have navigated to my Custom Role Mapping Page

Scenario: Reset to default role to right mapping
When I click on the Reset Mapping button
And I got a warning message saying "Are you sure you want to reset the mappings to factory defaults? This will remove any custom defined roles!"
When I click 'OK' on the warning message
Then the Leader, Educator, Aggregate Viewer and IT Administrator roles are now only mapped to themselves

@derp
Scenario: Create new group
When I click on the Add Group button
And I type the name "New Custom" in the Group name textbox
#Then the save button is disabled
When I add the right "READ_GENERAL" to the group "New Custom"   
And I add the role "Dummy" to the group "New Custom"
And I hit the save button
Then the group "New Custom" contains the roles "Dummy"
And the group "New Custom" contains the rights "Read General"

@derp
Scenario: Add role to existing group
When I create a new role <Role> to the group <Group> that allows <User> to access the API
| Group              | Role        | User      |
#| "Educator"         | "Teacher"   | "teacher" |
#| "Leader"           | "Principal" | "prince"  |
#| "IT Administrator" | "Admin"     | "root"    |
#| "Aggregate Viewer" | "Observer"  | "bigbro"  |
| "New Custom"       | "Custom"    | "custom"  |
Then I see the mapping in the table
And That user can now access the API

@derp
Scenario: Add rights to group
And the user "custom" can access the API with rights "Read General"
And I edit the group "New Custom"
When I add the right "WRITE_GENERAL" to the group "New Custom"
And I hit the save button
Then the group "New Custom" contains the rights "Read and Write General"
And I wait for 5 seconds
And the user "custom" can access the API with rights "Read and Write General"

@derp
Scenario: Remove rights from group
When I remove the right "WRITE_GENERAL" from the group "New Custom"
And I hit the save button
Then the group "New Custom" contains the rights "Read General"
And I wait for 5 seconds
And the user "custom" can access the API with rights "Read General"
When I remove the right "READ_GENERAL" from the group "New Custom"
And I hit the save button
Then I am informed that I must have at least one role and right in the group
And the user "custom" can access the API with rights "Read General"

Scenario: Remove role from group
When I remove the role <Role> from the group <Group> that denies <User> access to the API
| Group              | Role        | User      |
| "Educator"         | "Teacher"   | "teacher" |
| "Leader"           | "Principal" | "prince"  |
| "IT Administrator" | "Admin"     | "root"    |
| "Aggregate Viewer" | "Observer"  | "bigbro"  |
| "New Custom"       | "Custom"    | "custom"  |
Then I no longer see that mapping in the table
And That user can no longer access the API

Scenario: Cannot remove last role in group
When I remove the role "Dummy" from the group "New Custom"
And I hit the save button
Then I am informed that I must have at least one role and right in the group

Scenario: Remove group
When I remove the group "New Custom"
And I hit the save button
Then the group "New Custom" no longer appears on the page

Scenario: Cannot add duplicate rights within a group
When I edit the rights for the group <Group> to include the duplicate right <Right>
| Right             | Group              |
| "Read General"    | "Educator"         |
| "Write General"   | "IT Administrator" |
| "Read Restricted" | "Leader"           |
Then I cannot find the right in the dropdown

Scenario: Cannot add duplicate roles
When I edit the roles for the group <Group> to include the duplicate role <Role>
| Role               | Group              |
| "Educator"         | "Educator"         |
| "Educator"         | "IT Administrator" |
| "Aggregate Viewer" | "Leader"           |
Then I am informed that "Role names must be unique across all groups"

Scenario: Cancel button discards any unsaved changes for a group
When I add the right "Write General" to the group "Educator"
And I add the role "Teacher" to the group "Educator"
And I click the cancel button
Then the group "New Custom" contains the rights "Read General Public and Aggregate"
And the group "New Custom" contains the roles "Educator"

@wip
Scenario: Name validation for role and group names
#This requirement is questionable?  Redone to just make sure input is sanitized?
Given Something 
When something
Then something
