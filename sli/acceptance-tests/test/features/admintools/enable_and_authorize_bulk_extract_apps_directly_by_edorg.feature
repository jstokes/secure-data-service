Feature: Application Enablement and Authorization by Education Organization
	As a developer I want to be able to enable my application for specific states and education organizations.
	As an admin I want to be able to approve the applications that developers enabled for specific education organizations.

Background:
	Given I have an open web browser

	Scenario: Create new bulk extract application (set up data)
        Given I am a valid SLI Developer "admintest-developer@slidev.org" from the "SLI" hosted directory
        When I hit the Application Registration Tool URL
        And I was redirected to the "Simple" IDP Login page
        And I submit the credentials "slcdeveloper" "slcdeveloper1234" for the "Simple" login page
        Then I am redirected to the Application Registration Tool page
        And I have clicked to the button New
        And I am redirected to a new application page
        When I entered the name "Aboukir" into the field titled "Name"
        And I check Bulk Extract
        And I have entered data into the other required fields except for the shared secret and the app id which are read-only
        And I click on the button Submit
        Then I am redirected to the Application Registration Tool page
        And the application "Aboukir" is listed in the table on the top
        And the client ID and shared secret fields are Pending
        And the Registration Status field is Pending

    Scenario: SLC Operator accepts bulk extract application registration request (set up data)
        Given I am a valid SLC Operator "slcoperator-email@slidev.org" from the "SLI" hosted directory
        When I hit the Application Registration Tool URL
        And I was redirected to the "Simple" IDP Login page
        And I submit the credentials "slcoperator-email@slidev.org" "slcoperator-email1234" for the "Simple" login page
        Then I am redirected to the Application Approval Tool page
        And I see all the applications registered on SLI
        And I see all the applications pending registration
        And the pending apps are on top
        When I click on 'Approve' next to application "Aboukir"
        Then application "Aboukir" is registered
        And the 'Approve' button is disabled for application "Aboukir"
