	As a developer I want to be able to enable my application for specific states and education organizations.
	As an admin I want to be able to approve the applications that developers enabled for specific education organizations.

Background:
	Given I have an open web browser

	Scenario: Create new bulk extract application (set up data)
        Given I am a valid SLI Developer "admintest-developer@slidev.org" from the "SLI" hosted directory

        And I was redirected to the "Simple" IDP Login page
        And I submit the credentials "slcdeveloper" "slcdeveloper1234" for the "Simple" login page
        Then I am redirected to the Application Registration Tool page
        And I have clicked to the button New
        And I am redirected to a new application page

        And I have entered data into the other required fields except for the shared secret and the app id which are read-only
        And I click on the button Submit
        Then I am redirected to the Application Registration Tool page

        And I see all the applications pending registration
        And the pending apps are on top
