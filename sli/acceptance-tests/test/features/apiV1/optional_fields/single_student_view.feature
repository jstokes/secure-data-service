Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to view more student data in a single API call.
  This means I want to be able to apply optional fields to the url.

  Scenario Outline: Applying optional fields - attendances, assessments, gradebook
    Given I am logged in using "<username>" "<password>" to realm "IL"
    And format "application/vnd.slc+json"
    Given optional field "attendances"
    And optional field "assessments"
    And optional field "gradebook"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/students/<STUDENT_ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200

  # Attendaces
    And I should find "1" "attendances"
    And I should find "181" "attendances" in it
    Then I should see "date" is "2011-09-06" in one of them
    And I should see "event" is "In Attendance" in it

  # Assessments
    And I should find "1" "studentAssessments"
    And I should find "assessments" expanded in each of them
    Then I should see "administrationDate" is "2011-05-10" in one of them
    And inside "assessments"
    And I should see "academicSubject" is "Reading" in it
    And I should see "assessmentTitle" is "SAT" in it
