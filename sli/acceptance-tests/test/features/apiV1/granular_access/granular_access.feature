Feature: As an SLI API, I want to be able to provide granular access to data.
  This means the user is able to request all the data within a school year range.

  Background: Use JSON format
    Given format "application/json"

  Scenario Outline: All data is returned within a specific school year range - staff
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And parameter "limit" is "0"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<Entity URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "<Count Without Range>" entities
    Given parameter "schoolYears" is "<School Years>"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<Entity URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "<Count With Range>" entities
    And I should only find "<Entity List>" in the list of entities returned
    Examples:
    # 2009-2010: 2009-01-04 to 2010-12-16
    # 2010-2011: 2010-01-04 to 2011-12-16
    # 2011-2012: 2011-01-06 to 2012-06-31

  Scenario Outline: Time-insensitive entities
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And parameter "schoolYears" is "2010-2011"
    And parameter "limit" is "0"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<Entity URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 400
    # TODO: update error message
    And the error message should say "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
    Examples:

  Scenario Outline: Different ways of overlapping the date range
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And a new "studentSchoolAssociation"
    When I navigate to POST "/studentSchoolAssociations"
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
    And I should receive a new entity URI
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/studentSchoolAssociations/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "1" entities
    And the "entryDate" should be "2010-09-01"
    When I set the date "entryDate" to "<Entry Date>"
    And I set the date "exitWithdrawDate" to "<Exit Date>"
    And I navigate to PUT "/studentSchoolAssociations/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
    Given parameter "schoolYears" is "2009-2011"
    And the session date range is "2009-01-04" to "2011-12-16"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/studentSchoolAssociations/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "<Count>" entities
    And I delete the new "studentSchoolAssociation" for the next test scenario
    Examples:
    | Entry Date | Exit Date  | Count | # Note                                                |

  Scenario Outline: Optional begin date - teacherSectionAssociation
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And a new "teacherSectionAssociation"
    When I navigate to POST "/studentSchoolAssociations"
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
    And I should receive a new entity URI
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/teacherSectionAssociations/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "1" entities
    When I set the date "endDate" to "<Exit Date>"
    And I navigate to PUT "/teacherSectionAssociations/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
    Given parameter "schoolYears" is "2009-2011"
    And the session date range is "2009-09-06" to "2011-05-16"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/teacherSectionAssociations/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "<Count>" entities

    | ?          | 0     | # Starts unknown, ends unknown                          |

  Scenario: Provide a really wide school year range to "get everything"
    Given I am logged in using "linda.kim" "linda.kim1234" to realm "IL"
    And parameter "schoolYears" is "1900-2100"
    And parameter "limit" is "0"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/studentSchoolAssociations"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "67" entities
    Given parameter "schoolYears" is "2010-2011"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/studentSchoolAssociations"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    # TODO: update the count from above
    And I should receive a collection of "" entities

  Scenario Outline: Sad path - invalid date ranges
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And parameter "schoolYears" is "<Range>"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/studentSectionAssociations"
    Then I should receive a return code of 400
    # TODO: update error message
    And the error message should say "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
    Examples:
    | Range     | # Note                                |
    | 2011-2011 | # Same begin and end years            |
    | 2012-2009 | # Begin year is earlier than end year |
