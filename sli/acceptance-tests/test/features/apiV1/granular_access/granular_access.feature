Feature: As an SLI API, I want to be able to provide granular access to data.
  This means the user is able to request all the data within a school year range.

  Background: Use JSON format
    Given format "application/json"

  Scenario Outline: All data is returned within a specific school year range - staff
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And parameter "limit" is "0"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<Entity URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "<Count Without Range>" entities
    Given parameter "schoolYear" is "2010-2011"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<Entity URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "<Count With Range>" entities
    And I should only find "<Entity List>" in the list of entities returned
    Examples:
    | Entity URI                              | Count Without Range | Count With Range | Entity List |
    | attendances                             | 0                   | 99999            |             |

  Scenario Outline: Time-insensitive entities
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And parameter "schoolYear" is "2010-2011"
    And parameter "limit" is "0"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<Entity URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 400

  Scenario Outline: Different ways of overlapping the date range
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And a new "studentSchoolAssociation"
    When I navigate to POST "/studentSchoolAssociations"
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
    And I should receive a new entity URI
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/studentSchoolAssociations/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "1" entities
    And the "entryDate" should be "2010-09-01"
    When I set the date "entryDate" to "<Entry Date>"
    And I set the date "exitWithdrawDate" to "<Exit Date>"
    And I navigate to PUT "/studentSchoolAssociations/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
    Given parameter "schoolYear" is "2009-2011"
    And the session date range is "2009-09-06" to "2011-05-16"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/studentSchoolAssociations/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "<Count>" entities
    And I delete the new "studentSchoolAssociation" for the next test scenario
    Examples:
    | Entry Date | Exit Date  | Count | # Note                                                |

  Scenario Outline: Optional begin date - teacherSectionAssociation
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And a new "teacherSectionAssociation"
    When I navigate to POST "/studentSchoolAssociations"
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
    And I should receive a new entity URI
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/teacherSectionAssociations/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "1" entities
    When I set the date "endDate" to "<Exit Date>"
    And I navigate to PUT "/teacherSectionAssociations/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
    Given parameter "schoolYear" is "2009-2011"
    And the session date range is "2009-09-06" to "2011-05-16"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/teacherSectionAssociations/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "<Count>" entities
    And I delete the new "teacherSectionAssociation" for the next test scenario
    Examples:
    | Exit Date  | Count | # Note                                                  |
    | 2001-01-01 | 0     | # Starts unknown, ends before range starts              |
    | 2009-09-06 | 0     | # Starts unknown, ends on the same day the range starts |
    | 2010-01-01 | 1     | # Starts unknown, ends within range                     |
    | 2012-01-01 | 1     | # Starts unknown, ends after range ends                 |
    | ?          | 0     | # Starts unknown, ends unknown                          |

  Scenario Outline: Sad path - invalid date ranges
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And parameter "schoolYear" is "<Range>"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/studentSectionAssociations"
    Then I should receive a return code of 400
    # TODO: update error message
    And the error message should say "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
    Examples:
    | Range     | # Note                                |
    | 2011-2011 | # Same begin and end years            |
    | 1900-2100 | # Non-matching begin and end years    |
    | 2012-2009 | # Begin year is earlier than end year |
