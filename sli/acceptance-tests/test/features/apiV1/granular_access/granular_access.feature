Feature: As an SLI API, I want to be able to provide granular access to data.
  This means the user is able to request all the data within a school year range.

  Background: Use JSON format
    Given format "application/json"

  Scenario Outline: All data is returned within a specific school year range - staff
    Given I am logged in using "akopel" "akopel1234" to realm "IL"
    And parameter "limit" is "0"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<Entity URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "<Count Without Range>" entities
    Given parameter "schoolYears" is "<School Years>"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<Entity URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection of "<Count With Range>" entities
    And I should only find "<Entity List>" in the list of entities returned
    Examples:
    # 2008-2009: 2008-09-06 to 2009-05-16
    # 2010-2011: 2010-09-06 to 2010-12-16
