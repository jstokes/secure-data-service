Feature: As an SLI API, I want to be able to provide granular access to data.
  This means the user is able to request all the data within a school year range.

  Background: Use JSON format
    Given format "application/json"

  Scenario Outline: Result of elastic search should contain correct unicode encoding
    Given I am logged in using "akopel" "akopel1234" to realm "IL"
    And parameter "limit" is "0"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<Entity URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And  I should have entity with "<ENTITY ID>" and "<DESC>"
  Examples:
    | Entity URI | ENTITY ID | DESC |
    |search?q=cri%20tri%20geo|dd9165f2-653e-6f27-a82c-bfc5f4c757bc|Use congruence and similarity criteria for triangles to solve problems and to prove relationships in geometric figures.â˜…|
