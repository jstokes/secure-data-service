Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to support XML.
  This means the API should support POST, PUT and GET with XML format.

Background: Nothing yet
  Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
  And format "application/xml"

  Scenario Outline: Getting response from GET - Read
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<ENTITY URI>/<ENTITY ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive an XML document
    And I should see "<entityType>" is "<ENTITY TYPE>"

  Examples:
    | ENTITY URI                  | ENTITY TYPE                | ENTITY ID                               |
    | assessments                 | assessment                 | 2108c0c84ca6998eb157e1efd4d894746e1fdf8b_id |
    | schools                     | school                     | 92d6d5a0-852c-45f4-907a-912752831772    |
    | students                    | student                    | 3a8860f9-ffb1-40f2-89b4-84f3ba369204_id    |
    | studentSectionAssociations  | studentSectionAssociation  | 8ed12459-eae5-49bc-8b6b-6ebe1a56384f_id4ae72560-3518-4576-a35e-a9607668c9ad_id    |
    | courseOfferings             | courseOffering             | c5b80f7d-93c5-11e1-adcc-101f74582c4c    |

  Scenario Outline: Getting response from GET - Read all
  
	 #ES bug, set this back to zero after bug fix
    Given parameter "limit" is "250"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<ENTITY URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive an XML document
    And I should receive <ENTITY COUNT> entities
    And I should see each entity's "<entityType>" is "<ENTITY TYPE>"

    | students                    | student                    | 0               |
    | studentSectionAssociations  | studentSectionAssociation  | 0               |
    | courseOfferings             | courseOffering             | 138             |
