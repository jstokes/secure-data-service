Feature: Test CRUD fuctionality of Custom Entities with multiple roles

  Background: Setup for the tests
    Given the testing device app key has been created
    And I import the odin setup application and realm data
    And I have an open web browser

Scenario:  User can WRITE custom data to an EdOrg with Write Access, cannot Delete custom data in EdOrg without Write Access
    Given I change the custom role of "Leader" to add the "WRITE_RESTRICTED" right
    And I change the custom role of "Leader" to add the "WRITE_GENERAL" right
    And I change the custom role of "Leader" to add the "WRITE_PUBLIC" right
    When I navigate to the API authorization endpoint with my client ID
    And I was redirected to the "Simple" IDP Login page
    And I submit the credentials "rbelding" "rbelding1234" for the "Simple" login page
    Then I should receive a json response containing my authorization code
    When I navigate to the API token endpoint with my client ID, secret, authorization code, and redirect URI
    Then I should receive a json response containing my authorization token
    And I should be able to use the token to make valid API calls
    Then the following student section associations in Midgar are set correctly
