    Given the testing device app key has been created

    And I was redirected to the "Simple" IDP Login page
    And I submit the credentials "rbelding" "rbelding1234" for the "Simple" login page
    Then I should receive a json response containing my authorization code
    When I navigate to the API token endpoint with my client ID, secret, authorization code, and redirect URI
    Then I should receive a json response containing my authorization token
    And I should be able to use the token to make valid API calls
