  Scenario Outline: Get a student's data using various staff-student combination
    Given the only SEOA for "rbraverman" is as a "Educator" in "District 9"
    And the following student section associations in Midgar are set correctly
      | student         | teacher              | edorg                 | enrolledInAnySection? |
      | carmen.ortiz    | linda.kim            | Daybreak Central High | yes                   |
      | carmen.ortiz    | rbraverman           | Daybreak Central High | yes                   |
      | lashawn.taite   | linda.kim            | Daybreak Central High | no                    |
      | carmen.ortiz    | linda.kim            | Daybreak Bayside High | yes                   |
      | nate.dedrick    | linda.kim            | Daybreak Bayside High | yes                   |
      | mu.mcneill      | linda.kim            | Daybreak Bayside High | yes                   |
      | matt.sollars    | rbraverman           | East Daybreak High    | yes                   |

    When I navigate to the API authorization endpoint with my client ID
    And I was redirected to the "Simple" IDP Login page
    And I submit the credentials "<staff>" "<password>" for the "Simple" login page
    Then I should receive a json response containing my authorization code
    When I navigate to the API token endpoint with my client ID, secret, authorization code, and redirect URI
    Then I should receive a json response containing my authorization token
    And I should be able to use the token to make valid API calls

    Given format "application/json"
    When I navigate to GET "<student's URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200

    Examples:
    | staff       | password                  | student's URI           |
