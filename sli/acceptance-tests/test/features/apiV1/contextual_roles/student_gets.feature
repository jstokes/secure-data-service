    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And the response should have general student data
    And the response should not have restricted student data

    Given I expire all section associations that "carmen.ortiz" has with "rbraverman"
    And "carmen.ortiz" is not associated with any program that belongs to "rbraverman"
    And "carmen.ortiz" is not associated with any cohort that belongs to "rbraverman"
    When I navigate to GET "<carmen.ortiz URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 403
