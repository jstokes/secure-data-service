Feature: As a staff member API user with multiple roles over different edOrgs,
  I want to be able to perform all CRUD operations on all other entities.

  Background: Setup for the tests
    Given I import the odin setup application and realm data
    And the testing device app key has been created


# Single segment (/<ENTITY>) URI tests.

  Scenario Outline: Ensure GET can be performed on all public entities with READ_PUBLIC right
    Given I change the custom role of "Leader" to add the "READ_PUBLIC" right
    Given I change the custom role of "Educator" to add the "READ_PUBLIC" right
    And I log in as "jmacey"
    And parameter "limit" is "0"
    Given entity type "<ENTITY TYPE>"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<ENTITY URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should see all global entities

  Examples:
    | ENTITY TYPE                | ENTITY URI                  |

    And I log in as "jmacey"
    And parameter "limit" is "0"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<ENTITY URI>"

    And I log in as "jmacey"
    And parameter "limit" is "0"
    Given entity type "<ENTITY TYPE>"
