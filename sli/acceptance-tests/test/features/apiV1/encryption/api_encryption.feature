Feature: Test database encryption.
    As a client application using SLI
    I want to have create, read, update, and delete functionality for a student.

Background: Logged in as a super-user and using the small data set
    Given I am logged in using "demo" "demo1234"
      And I have access to all students
      And format "application/vnd.slc+json"

Scenario: Student data created via the API should be encrypted
   Given no record exists in "student" with a "body.studentUniqueStateId" of "530425896"
        And a valid entity json document for a "student"
    When I navigate to POST "/<STUDENT URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
        And I should receive an ID for the newly created entity
    When I navigate to GET "/<STUDENT URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
    Then the "name" should be "Rhonda" "Shannon" "Delgado"
        And the "birthDate" should be "2006-07-02"
        And the "sex" should be "Female"
        And the "studentUniqueStateId" should be "530425896"
    When I find a mongo record in "student" with "body.studentUniqueStateId" equal to "530425896"
        # UNENCRYPTED FIELDS
        And the field "body.studentUniqueStateId" has value "530425896"
        And the field "body.cohortYears[0].schoolYear" has value "2010-2011"
        And the field "body.cohortYears[0].cohortYearType" has value "First grade"
        And the field "body.studentIndicators[0].indicatorName" has value "At risk"
        And the field "body.studentIndicators[0].indicator" has value "At risk"
        # ENCRYPTED FIELDS

Scenario: Sorting on PII across a hop should fail
    Given format "application/json"
        And parameter "sortBy" is "name.firstName"
        And parameter "sortOrder" is "descending"
    When I navigate to GET "/<SCHOOL URI>/<Krypton Middle School ID>/<STUDENT SCHOOL ASSOCIATION URI>/<STUDENT URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 400
    Given parameter "full-entities" is "true"
    When I navigate to GET "/<SCHOOL URI>/<Krypton Middle School ID>/<STUDENT SCHOOL ASSOCIATION URI>/<STUDENT URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 400
    Given parameter "sort-by" is "studentUniqueStateId"
    When I navigate to GET "/<SCHOOL URI>/<Krypton Middle School ID>/<STUDENT SCHOOL ASSOCIATION URI>/<STUDENT URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200

Scenario: Can query PII fields by exact matching
    Given format "application/json"
        And student Rhonda Delagio exists
        And Ronda Delagio is associated with "<Krypton Middle School ID>".
        And parameter "name.firstName" is "Rhonda"
    When I navigate to GET "/<SCHOOL URI>/<Krypton Middle School ID>/<STUDENT SCHOOL ASSOCIATION URI>/<STUDENT URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
        And all students should have "name.firstName" equal to "Rhonda"
    Given parameter "name.firstName" is not "Rhonda"
    When I navigate to GET "/<SCHOOL URI>/<Krypton Middle School ID>/<STUDENT SCHOOL ASSOCIATION URI>/<STUDENT URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
        And no student should have "name.firstName" equal to "Rhonda"

Scenario: Can not query PII fields by non-exact matching
    Given format "application/json"
        And student Rhonda Delagio exists
        And Ronda Delagio is associated with "<Krypton Middle School ID>".
        And parameter "name.firstName" less than "Rhonda"
    When I navigate to GET "/<SCHOOL URI>/<Krypton Middle School ID>/<STUDENT SCHOOL ASSOCIATION URI>/<STUDENT URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 400
    Given parameter "name.firstName" greater than "Rhonda"
    When I navigate to GET "/<SCHOOL URI>/<Krypton Middle School ID>/<STUDENT SCHOOL ASSOCIATION URI>/<STUDENT URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 400
    Given parameter "name.firstName" greater than or equal to "Rhonda"
    When I navigate to GET "/<SCHOOL URI>/<Krypton Middle School ID>/<STUDENT SCHOOL ASSOCIATION URI>/<STUDENT URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 400
    Given parameter "name.firstName" less than or equal to "Rhonda"
    When I navigate to GET "/<SCHOOL URI>/<Krypton Middle School ID>/<STUDENT SCHOOL ASSOCIATION URI>/<STUDENT URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 400
    Given parameter "name.firstName" matches via regex "Rhonda"
    When I navigate to GET "/<SCHOOL URI>/<Krypton Middle School ID>/<STUDENT SCHOOL ASSOCIATION URI>/<STUDENT URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 400
