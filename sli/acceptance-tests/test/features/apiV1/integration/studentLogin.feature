  Scenario Outline: Student has access to stuff
    Given I log in to realm "Illinois Daybreak Students" using simple-idp as student "student.m.sollars" with password "student.m.sollars1234"
    And format "application/json"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/<Entity>/<Ids>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
  Examples:

   Scenario: Verify Rewrites for Base Level entities for Students
     Given I log in to realm "Illinois Daybreak Students" using simple-idp as student "cegray" with password "cegray1234"
     And my contextual access is defined by the table:
       | Context                | Ids                                         |

     When I navigate to the base level URI <Entity> I should see the rewrite in the format of <URI>:

Scenario: Student has access to entities via API entpoints
Given I log in to realm "Illinois Daybreak Students" using simple-idp as student "student.m.sollars" with password "student.m.sollars1234"
  And format "application/json"
  And I am using api version "v1"
 When I validate I have access to entities via the API access pattern "/v1/Entity/Id":
    | entity                    | id                                          |
