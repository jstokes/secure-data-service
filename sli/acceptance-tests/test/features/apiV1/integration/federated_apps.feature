Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to perform CRUD operations on application resource

  Background: No extra setup required
    Given format "application/vnd.slc+json"

#Why does this have to be an integration test? Because changes to StaffEducationOrganizationAssociation are reflected only after re-login and re-login requires SimpleIDP.
  #jstevenson can access applications for his schools

  Scenario: CRUD operations involving developers, slcoperators, and federated users with APP_AUTHORIZE rights
    Given I log in to realm "Illinois Daybreak School District 4529" using simple-idp as "IT Administrator" "rrogers" with password "rrogers1234"
    And format "application/vnd.slc+json"

    And I create a LEA named "FLEA1"
    And I create a School named "FSchool1" with parents "FLEA1"
    And I create a School named "FSchool2" with parents "FLEA1"
    And I login as developer "developer" and create application named "US5865 Application 1"
    And I login as slcoperator and approve application named "US5865 Application 1"

    #jstevenson cannot access application because (1.) Developer has not enabled app for FSchool1 (2.) jstevenson does not have context with FSchool1
    And I log in to realm "Illinois Daybreak School District 4529" using simple-idp as "IT Administrator" "jstevenson" with password "jstevenson1234"
