  I want to verify that URI paths that don't make sense for students to access are denied or rewritten

  Scenario: Verify Rewrites for Base Level entities for Students
    Given I log in to realm "Illinois Daybreak Students" using simple-idp as student "cegray" with password "cegray1234"
    And my contextual access is defined by the table:
      | Context                | Ids                                                                                                                                                                             |

    And format "application/json"
    When I navigate to the base level URI <Entity> I should see the rewrite in the format of <URI>:
