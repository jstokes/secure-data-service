@student_path
Feature: Path Based Security for Student Authentication
  I want to verify that URI paths that don't make sense for students to access are denied or rewritten

Scenario: Check un-versioned URIs work for student
  Given I log in to realm "Illinois Daybreak Students" using simple-idp as "student" "cegray" with password "cegray1234"
  When I make requests to both the versioned and un-versioned URI "/system/session/check"
  Then both responses should be identical in return code and body
  When I make requests to both the versioned and un-versioned URI "/system/session/debug"
  Then both responses should be identical in return code and body
  When I navigate to GET "/v1/system/support/email"
  Then I should receive a return code of 200
  When I navigate to GET "/userapps"
  Then I should receive a return code of 200
  When I navigate to GET "/system/session/logout"
  Then any future API request should result in a 401 response code

Scenario: Verify Rewrites for Base Level entities for Students
  Given I log in to realm "Illinois Daybreak Students" using simple-idp as "student" "cegray" with password "cegray1234"
  And my contextual access is defined by the table:
