Feature: As a user of the SLC API I would like to see various endpoints exist.

Background: Nothing yet
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    Scenario Outline: Check that the urls requested do actually exist
        When I navigate to <url> with <id>
        Then I should receive a valid return code
    Examples:
        | url                                                                     | id                                     | 
        | "/schools/#{id}/courses"                                                | "67ce204b-9999-4a11-bfea-000000000005" |
        | "/schools/#{id}/courseOfferings"                                        | "67ce204b-9999-4a11-bfea-000000000005" |
        | "/schools/#{id}/sessions"                                               | "67ce204b-9999-4a11-bfea-000000000005" |
