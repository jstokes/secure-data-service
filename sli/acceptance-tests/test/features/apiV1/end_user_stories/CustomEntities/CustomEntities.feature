Feature: Test CRUD fuctionality of Custom Entities per application 
Application is authorized using OAuth (there is an client_id and client_secret).  Custom entities are partitioned by application. Access control inherited from parent.


Background: None


Scenario:  As an IT Admin, I want to add custom entitiy to a core entity belonging to my application
    #create a new custom entity for demoClient
    Given  I am a valid SEA/LEA end user "rrogers" with password "rrogers1234"
    And the clientID is "demoClient"
    And I am authenticated on "IL"
   
    Given format "application/json"
    And a valid entity json object for a "educationOrganizations"
    And I add a key value pair "CustomConfig" : "<?xml version=1.0?><DisplayName>StateTest Reading Results</DisplayName>" to the object
	When I navigate to POST "/<EDUCATION ORGANIZATION URI>/<EDUCATION ORGANIZATION ID>/<CUSTOM URI>"
	Then I should receive a return code of 201
	And I should receive a Location header for the custom entity
	
	#create a new custom entity for sampleApplication
	Given  I am a valid SEA/LEA end user "rrogers" with password "rrogers1234"
    And the clientID is "SampleApplication"
     And I am authenticated on "IL"
     
    Given format "application/json" 
    And a valid entity json object for a "educationOrganizations"
    And I add a key value pair "CustomConfig" : "<?xml version=1.0?><DisplayName>SAT Scores</DisplayName>" to the object
	When I navigate to POST "/<EDUCATION ORGANIZATION URI>/<EDUCATION ORGANIZATION ID>/<CUSTOM URI>"
	Then I should receive a return code of 201
	
	#retrieve correct custom entity for correct application
    Given  I am a valid SEA/LEA end user "rrogers" with password "rrogers1234"
    And the clientID is "demoClient"
    And I am authenticated on "IL"
	When I navigate to GET "/<EDUCATION ORGANIZATION URI>/<EDUCATION ORGANIZATION ID>/<CUSTOM URI>"
	Then I should receive a key value pair "CustomConfig" : "<?xml version=1.0?><DisplayName>StateTest Reading Results</DisplayName>" in the result
