	Examples:
	| Username     | Password        | RC  | Role       | EdOrg                      |
	| "linda.kim"  | "linda.kim1234" | 200 | "Educator" | "Daybreak Middle School"   |
	| "sbantu"     | "sbantu1234"    | 200 | "Leader"   | "DayBreak School District" |


Scenario Outline: As teacher or leader in the Daybreak district but outside Daybreak Middle School, I should not have access to Linda Kim's students
    Given I am logged in using <Username> <Password> to realm "IL"
     And format "application/json"
     And the sli securityEvent collection is empty
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/teachers/<'Linda Kim' ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of <RC>
     And a security event matching "^Access Denied" should be in the sli db
     And I check to find if record is in sli db collection:
       | collectionName      | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter       | searchValue                           |

Scenario Outline: As a teacher or leader in another district I cannot see any of Linda Kim's students in her 3rd period Algebra II class
    Given I am logged in using <Username> <Password> to realm "IL"
     And format "application/json"
     And the sli securityEvent collection is empty
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/teachers/<'Linda Kim' ID>"
