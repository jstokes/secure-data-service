Feature: List Students in SampleApp
As a SEA/LEA user, I want to be able to see list of students
Background:
  Given I have an open web browser
  Given the sampleApp is deployed on sampleApp server

Scenario: Teacher sees list of students
  When I navigate to the sampleApp home page
  Then I should be redirected to the Realm page
  When I select "Illinois Sunset School District 4526" and click go
  When I login as "cgray" "cgray1234"
  When I go to List of Students
  Then the page should include a table with header "List of Students"
  And I should see student "Ashley, Jolene" in the student list
