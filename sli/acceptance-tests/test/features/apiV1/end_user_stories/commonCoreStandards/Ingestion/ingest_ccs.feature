Feature: Common Core Standard Ingestion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
  And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

Scenario: Post a zip file containing all configured Learning Objective interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I post "grade12English.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName              |
     | learningObjective                  |
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName              | count |
     | learningObjective           | 5     |
   And I check to find if record is in collection:
     | collectionName              | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter                                | searchValue           |
     | learningObjective           | 1                   | body.learningObjective.description             | Reading: Informational Text  |
     | learningObjective           | 1                   | body.learningObjective.grade                   | Twelfth                               |
 
  And I should see "Processed 5 records." in the resulting batch job file
  And I should not see an error log file created
  And I should see "grade12English.xml records considered: 5" in the resulting batch job file
  And I should see "grade12English.xml records ingested successfully: 4" in the resulting batch job file
  And I should see "grade12English.xml records failed: 0" in the resulting batch job file

  And I should see "Processed 10 records." in the resulting batch job file
  And I should not see an error log file created
  And I should see "grade12English.xml records considered: 10" in the resulting batch job file
