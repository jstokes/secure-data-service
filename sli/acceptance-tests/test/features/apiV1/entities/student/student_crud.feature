Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to manage students
    As a client application using SLI
    I want to have create, read, update, and delete functionality for a student.

Background: Logged in as a super-user and using the small data set
	Given I am logged in using "demo" "demo1234"
	Given I have access to all students

#### Happy Path 
Scenario: Create a new student JSON
     Given format "application/json"
        And the "name" is "Mister" "John" "Doe"
        And the "birthDate" is "1994-04-04"
        And the "sex" is "Male"
        And the "studentUniqueStateId" is "123456"
    When I navigate to POST "/v1/students/" 
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
       And I should receive an ID for the newly created student
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/students/<'newly created student' ID>"
    Then the "name" should be "Mister" "John" "Doe"
       And the "birthDate" should be "1994-04-04"
       And the "sex" should be "Male"
       And the "studentUniqueStateId" should be "123456"
                
Scenario: Read a student by id
    Given format "application/vnd.slc+json"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/students/<'Alfonso' ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
        And the "name" should be "Alfonso" "Ora" "Steele"
        And the "sex" should be "Male"
        And the "birthDate" should be "1999-07-12"
        And I should receive a link named "getStudentSectionAssociations" with URI "/v1/students/<'Alfonso' ID>/studentSectionAssociations"
        And I should receive a link named "getSections" with URI "/v1/students/<'Alfonso' ID>/studentSectionAssociations/sections"
        And I should receive a link named "getStudentSchoolAssociations" with URI "/v1/students/<'Alfonso' ID>/studentSchoolAssociations"
        And I should receive a link named "getSchools" with URI "/v1/students/<'Alfonso' ID>/studentSchoolAssociations/schools"
        And I should receive a link named "getStudentAssessmentAssociations" with URI "/v1/students/<'Alfonso' ID>/studentAssessmentAssociations"
        And I should receive a link named "getAssessments" with URI "/v1/students/<'Alfonso' ID>/studentAssessmentAssociations/assessments"
        And I should receive a link named "self" with URI "/v1/students/<'Alfonso' ID>"

Scenario: Update an existing student
    Given format "application/json"
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/students/<'Priscilla' ID>"
    Then the "birthDate" should be "2003-01-22"
    When I set the "birthDate" to "2001-01-22"
      And I navigate to PUT "/v1/students/<'Priscilla' ID>"
      Then I should receive a return code of 204
    When I navigate to GET "/v1/students/<'Priscilla' ID>"
     Then the "birthDate" should be "2001-01-22"
        
Scenario: Delete an existing student
    Given format "application/json"
    When I navigate to DELETE "/v1/students/<'Rachel' ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
    When  I navigate to GET "/v1/students/<'Rachel' ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 404
