Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to perform CRUD operations on various resources
This means I want to be able to perform CRUD on all entities.
and verify that the correct links are made available.
  
Background: Nothing yet
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
      And format "application/vnd.slc+json"

	Scenario Outline: CRUD operations on an entity
		# Create
	   Given a valid entity json document for a <EntityType>
	    When I navigate to POST "/v1/<EntityURI>"
	    Then I should receive a return code of 201
	     And I should receive a new entity URI
		# Read
	    When I navigate to GET "/<EntityURI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY URI>"
	    Then I should receive a return code of 200
	     And the response should contain the appropriate fields and values
	     And "entityType" should be <EntityType>
	     And I should receive a link named "self" with URI "/<EntityURI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY URI>"
	     And the tenant ID of the entity should be "IL"
		# Update 
	    When I set the <UpdateField> to <UpdatedValue>
	     And I navigate to PUT "/<EntityURI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY URI>"
	    Then I should receive a return code of 204
	     And I navigate to GET "/<EntityURI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY URI>"
	     And <UpdateField> should be <UpdatedValue>
		# Delete
	    When I navigate to DELETE "/<EntityURI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY URI>"
	    Then I should receive a return code of 204
	     And I navigate to GET "/<EntityURI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY URI>"
	     And I should receive a return code of 404
