Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to perform CRUD operations on various resources
  This means I want to be able to perform CRUD on all entities.
  and verify that the correct links are made available.

  Background: Nothing yet
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And format "application/vnd.slc+json"


  Scenario Outline: CRUD operations requiring explicit associations on an entity as staff
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And format "application/vnd.slc+json"
    Given entity URI <Entity Resource URI>
  # Create
    Given a valid entity json document for a <Entity Type>
    When I navigate to POST "/<ENTITY URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
    And I should receive a new entity URI
  # Association
    When I create an association of type <Association Type>
    When I POST the association of type <Association Type>
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
  # Read
    When I navigate to GET "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And a valid entity json document for a <Entity Type>
    And the response should contain the appropriate fields and values
    And "entityType" should be <Entity Type>
    And I should receive a link named "self" with URI "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
  # Update
    When I set the <Update Field> to <Updated Value>
    And I navigate to PUT "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
    And I navigate to GET "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
    And <Update Field> should be <Updated Value>
  # Delete
    When I navigate to DELETE "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
    And I navigate to GET "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
    And I should receive a return code of 404

  Examples:
    | Entity Type | Entity Resource URI | Association Type                         | Update Field             | Updated Value            |
