Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to perform CRUD operations on various resources
This means I want to be able to perform CRUD on all entities.
and verify that the correct links are made available.

Background: Nothing yet
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
      And format "application/vnd.slc+json"



    Scenario Outline: CRUD operations requiring explicit associations on an entity as staff
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
      And format "application/vnd.slc+json"
       Given entity URI <Entity Resource URI>
        # Create
       Given a valid entity json document for a <Entity Type>
        When I navigate to POST "/<ENTITY URI>"
        Then I should receive a return code of 201
         And I should receive a new entity URI
        # Association
        When I create an association of type <Association Type>
        When I POST the association of type <Association Type>
        Then I should receive a return code of 201
        # Read
        When I navigate to GET "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
        Then I should receive a return code of 200
         And a valid entity json document for a <Entity Type>
         And the response should contain the appropriate fields and values
         And "entityType" should be <Entity Type>
         And I should receive a link named "self" with URI "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"

  #crud assessment / studentAssessment and verify in mongo it's superdoc'ed 
  @US5365 @AssmtTest
  Scenario: crud on super assessment and super studentAssessment 
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
      And entity URI "/v1/assessments"
      And format "application/vnd.slc+json"
      And a valid entity json document for a "super_assessment"
      When I navigate to POST "<ENTITY URI>"
      Then I should receive a return code of 201
        And I should receive a new entity URI
        And I verify "objectiveAssessment" and "assessmentItem" should be subdoc'ed in mongo for this new "assessment"
        And I verify there are "1" "assessmentPeriodDescriptor" with "codeValue=codeGreen"
      When I navigate to GET "/assessments/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
        Then I should receive a return code of 200
        And I verify "objectiveAssessment, assessmentPeriodDescriptor" and "assessmentItem" is collapsed in response body 
        And "objectiveAssessment" is hierachical with childrens at "objectiveAssessments"
      When I set the "lowestGradeLevelAssessed" to "Sixth grade"
        And I set the "codeValue" to "codeRed" in "assessmentPeriodDescriptor"
        And I navigate to PUT "/assessments/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
        Then I should receive a return code of 204
         And I verify "objectiveAssessment" and "assessmentItem" should be subdoc'ed in mongo for this new "assessment"
         And I verify there are "1" "assessmentPeriodDescriptor" with "codeValue=codeRed"
         And I verify there are "0" "assessmentPeriodDescriptor" with "codeValue=codeGreen"
         And I navigate to GET "/assessments/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
         And "lowestGradeLevelAssessed" should be "Sixth grade"
     # the corresponding studentAssessment 
     Given entity URI "/v1/studentAssessments"
       And a valid entity json document for a "studentAssessment"
       When I navigate to POST "<ENTITY URI>"
       Then I should receive a return code of 201
        And I should receive a new entity URI
        And I verify "studentObjectiveAssessment" and "studentAssessmentItem" should be subdoc'ed in mongo for this new "studentAssessment"
       When I navigate to GET "/studentAssessments/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
       Then I should receive a return code of 200
        # verifies DID and associations between studentAssessment and assessment
        And I verify "studentObjectiveAssessments" and "studentAssessmentItems" is collapsed in response body 
        And I verify there are "2" "studentObjectiveAssessments" in response body
       When I set the "administrationEnvironment" to "School"
        And I navigate to PUT "/studentAssessments/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
        Then I should receive a return code of 204
         And I verify "studentObjectiveAssessment" and "studentAssessmentItem" should be subdoc'ed in mongo for this new "studentAssessment"
         When I navigate to GET "/studentAssessments/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
         And "administrationEnvironment" should be "School"
     Then I delete both studentAssessment and Assessment
