Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to perform CRUD operations on various resources
This means I want to be able to perform CRUD on all entities.
and verify that the correct links are made available.

Background: Nothing yet
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
      And format "application/vnd.slc+json"


        Scenario Outline: CRUD operations on an entity
       Given entity URI <Entity Resource URI>
        # Create
       Given a valid entity json document for a <Entity Type>
        When I navigate to POST "/<ENTITY URI>"
        Then I should receive a return code of 201
         And I should receive a new entity URI
        # Read
        When I navigate to GET "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
        Then I should receive a return code of 200
         And the response should contain the appropriate fields and values
         And "entityType" should be <Entity Type>
         And I should receive a link named "self" with URI "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
        # Update
        When I set the <Update Field> to <Updated Value>
         And I navigate to PUT "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
        Then I should receive a return code of 204
         And I navigate to GET "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
         And <Update Field> should be <Updated Value>
        # Delete
        When I navigate to DELETE "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
        Then I should receive a return code of 204
         And I navigate to GET "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
         And I should receive a return code of 404

    Scenario Outline: Get All Entities as School Teacher
    
    Given I am logged in using "linda.kim" "linda.kim1234" to realm "IL"
     And format "application/vnd.slc+json"
    Given entity URI <Entity Resource URI>
    Given parameter "limit" is "0"
     When I navigate to GET "/<ENTITY URI>"
     Then I should receive a return code of 200
      And I should receive a collection of "<Entity Count>" entities
      And each entity's "entityType" should be <Entity Type>
