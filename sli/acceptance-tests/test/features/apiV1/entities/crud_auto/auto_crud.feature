Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to perform CRUD operations on various resources
This means I want to be able to perform CRUD on all entities.
and verify that the correct links are made available.

Background: Nothing yet
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
      And format "application/vnd.slc+json"


        Scenario: CRUD operations on an entity
    #       Given entity URI <Entity Resource URI>
        # Create
        #        Given a valid entity json document for each resource available
        Then I perform CRUD for each resource available
        # Update
#        When I set the <Update Field> to <Updated Value>
#         And I navigate to PUT "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
#        Then I should receive a return code of 204
#         And I navigate to GET "/<ENTITY URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ENTITY ID>"
#         And <Update Field> should be <Updated Value>
