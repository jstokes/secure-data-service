Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to perform CRUD operations on association resources.
  This means I want to be able to perform CRUD on all association entities
  and verify that the correct links are made available.

  Background: Logged in as IT Admin Rick Rogers
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And format "application/vnd.slc+json"

    Scenario Outline: CRUD round trip for an association entity
      # Create
      Given a valid association json document for <ASSOC TYPE>
      When I navigate to POST "/<ASSOC URI>"
      Then I should receive a return code of 201
      And I should receive a new ID for the association I just created
      # Read
      When I navigate to GET "/<ASSOC URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ASSOC ID>"
      Then I should receive a return code of 200
      And the response should contain the appropriate fields and values
      And "entityType" should be "<ASSOC TYPE>"
      And "<UPDATE FIELD>" should be "<OLD VALUE>"
      # Update
      When I set the "<UPDATE FIELD>" to "<NEW VALUE>"
      And I navigate to PUT "/<ASSOC URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ASSOC ID>"
      Then I should receive a return code of 204
      And I navigate to GET "/<ASSOC URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ASSOC ID>"
      And "<UPDATE FIELD>" should be "<NEW VALUE>"
      # Delete
      When I navigate to DELETE "/<ASSOC URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ASSOC ID>"
      Then I should receive a return code of 204
      And I navigate to GET "/<ASSOC URI>/<NEWLY CREATED ASSOC ID>"
      And I should receive a return code of 404

    Examples:
