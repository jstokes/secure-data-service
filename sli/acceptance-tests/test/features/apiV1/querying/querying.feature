Feature: Querying the API to receive subsets of results
 
Scenario Outline: Confirm ability to use all API query operators with different data type
  Given I am logged in using <username> <password> to realm "NY"
    And format "application/json;charset=utf-8"
   When parameter "limit" is "0"
    And parameter <field name> <operator> <operand>
    And I query <resource name> of <school id> to demonstrate <test type>
   Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection with <entities returned> elements
  Examples:
    | username               | password                   | resource name                        | school id                              | field name              | operator | operand            | entities returned | test type |

Scenario Outline: Test that include fields only affect body fields (type remains)
  Given I am logged in using <username> <password> to realm "IL"
    And format "application/json"
   When I navigate to GET "/v1/students/0fb8e0b4-8f84-48a4-b3f0-9ba7b0513dba?includeFields=name,sex"
   Then the "name" should be "Lashawn" "Lawrence" "Aldama"
    And the "sex" should be "Male"
    And the "entityType" should be "student"
    Examples:
      | username           | password              |
      | "rrogers"          | "rrogers1234"         |
