Feature: Querying the API to receive subsets of results
 
Scenario Outline: Confirm ability to use all API query operators with different data type
  Given I am logged in using "jpratt" "jpratt1234" to realm "NY"
    And format "application/json;charset=utf-8"
   When parameter "limit" is "0"
    And parameter <field name> <operator> <operand>
    And I query <resource name> to demonstrate <test type>
   Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive a collection with <entities returned> elements
  Examples:
    | resource name    | field name              | operator | operand            | entities returned | test type |
