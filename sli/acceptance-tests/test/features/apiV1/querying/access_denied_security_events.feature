Feature: As an SLI application, I want to ensure security events are created for unauthorized access

  Background: None

  Scenario : Confirm that Access Denied Exceptions are handled and SecurityEvents logged
    When I am logged in using "linda.kim" "linda.kim1234" to realm "IL"
    And format "application/vnd.slc+json"
    And the sli securityEvent collection is empty
    And I navigate to GET "/v1.3/disciplineIncidents/0e26de79-222a-5e67-9201-5113ad50a03b/studentDisciplineIncidentAssociations"
    Then I should receive a return code of 403
    And I should see a count of "1" in the security event collection
    And a security event matching "Cannot access endpoint." should be in the sli db
    And I check to find if record is in sli db collection:
       | collectionName  | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter         | searchValue                                                      | searchType |
