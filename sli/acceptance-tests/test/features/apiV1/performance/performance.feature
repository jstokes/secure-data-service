Feature: Ensure API performance meets defined thresholds

# vmcglaughlin 20120716: Using fixture data until a large dataset can be stored on each CI node
#Background: Load database with large dataset
#  Given I copy the database "apiperf" to database "sli"

Scenario Outline: Check API performance for a staff
  Given I want to execute each call "100" times
    And I want to log in as "rrogers" to realm "IL"
  When I execute a series of GETs on "<resource>"
  Then the "<AVERAGE TIME STAT>" should be less than <average time> ms
    And the "<90TH PERCENTILE STAT>" should be less than <90th percentile> ms
   Examples:
    | resource                | average time | 90th percentile |
    | /system/session/check   | 1000         | 1200            |
    | /educationOrganizations | 1000         | 1200            |
    | /programs               | 1000         | 1200            |
    | /cohorts                | 1000         | 1200            |
    | /students               | 1000         | 1200            |
    | /schools                | 1000         | 1200            |
    | /sections               | 1000         | 1200            |
