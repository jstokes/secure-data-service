Feature: White list input validation for API - core entities

  Background: Logged in as a super-user and using the small data set
    Given I am logged in using "rrogers" "rrogers1234" to realm "IL"
    And format "application/json"

    @wip
  Scenario Outline: Giant list of white list validations
    Given a valid document for <entity>
    When I navigate to POST "/v1/<entity uri>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
    When I change <key> to <invalid value>
    And I navigate to POST "/v1/<entity uri>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 400
    And I should see "pattern" in the error message

  Examples:
