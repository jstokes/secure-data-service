Feature: Attendance in the dashboard

As a SEA/LEA user, I want to be able to see various
attendance data for a list of students.

Background:
    Given I have an open web browser
And that dashboard has been authorized for all ed orgs

Scenario: Monster test until LOS is faster
    When I navigate to the Dashboard home page
    When I select "Illinois Sunset School District 4526" and click go
    And I was redirected to the "Simple" IDP Login page
    When I submit the credentials "cgray" "cgray1234" for the "Simple" login page
      When I select <edOrg> "Daybreak School District 4529"
        And I select <school> "Daybreak Central High"
        And I select <course> "American Literature"
        And I select <section> "Sec 145"
