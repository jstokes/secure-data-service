Feature: K-3 student list view

As a SEA/LEA user, I want to see the K-4 student list view
on SLI, so I could see elementary school students results

Scenario: Check assessment result (live)
#TODO when fuel gauge works
Given I have an open web browser
Given that dashboard has been authorized for all ed orgs
And I am authenticated to SLI as "rbraverman" password "rbraverman"
When I select ed org "Daybreak School District 4529"
When I select school "South Daybreak Elementary"
And I select course "Reading Group"
And I select section "Reading Group - Grey"
And I wait for "2" seconds
Then the fuel gauge label for the assessment "READ2_NEXT.Mastery level" and student "111111111" is "2"
