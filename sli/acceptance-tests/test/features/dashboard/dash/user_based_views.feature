Feature: User based view selection

As a SEA/LEA user, I want to be able to select different views in my dashboard
application, that will change the subset of information that is displayed.

Background:
  Given I have an open web browser

Scenario: Check user has multiple views available
#bundled with test in population_widget
  Given the server is in "test" mode
  Given I am authenticated to SLI as "cgray" "cgray"
  When I select <edOrg> "Daybreak School District 4529"
    And I select <school> "Daybreak Central High"
    And I select <course> "American Literature"
    And I select <section> "Sec 145"
  Then I should have a dropdown selector named "viewSelector"
    And I should have a selectable view named "IL_3-8_ELA"
    And I should have a selectable view named "IL_9-12"


Scenario: Views are filtered based on student grades

    And I select <section> "Sec 923"
