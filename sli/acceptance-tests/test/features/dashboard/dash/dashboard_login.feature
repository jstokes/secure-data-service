Feature: Dashboard User Login Authentication

As a SEA/LEA user, I want to use the SLI IDP Login to authenticate 
on SLI, so I could use the Dashboard application.

@wip
Scenario: Go to Dashboard page when not authenticated to SLI
#Moved to the valid user login test below
Given I have an open web browser
Given the server is in "live" mode
When I navigate to the Dashboard home page
Then I should be redirected to the Realm page

Scenario: Go to Dashboard page when authenticated to SLI
#This login scenario is covered in student_profile tests
Given I have an open web browser

When I select "Sunset School District 4526" and click go
And I wait for "1" seconds
When I login as "linda.kim" "linda.kim1234"
And I wait for "2" seconds
Then I should be redirected to the Dashboard landing page
