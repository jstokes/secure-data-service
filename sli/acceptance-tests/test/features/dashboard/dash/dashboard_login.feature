Feature: Dashboard User Login Authentication

As a SEA/LEA user, I want to use the SLI IDP Login to authenticate
on SLI, so I could use the Dashboard application.

Scenario: Valid user login

Given I have an open web browser
Given the server is in "live" mode
#hitting static URL
When I access "/static/html/test.html"
Then I can see "Static HTML page"
When I navigate to the Dashboard home page
Then I should be redirected to the Realm page
When I select "Illinois Daybreak School District 4529" and click go
 And I was redirected to the "Simple" IDP Login page
 When I submit the credentials "linda.kim" "linda.kim1234" for the "Simple" login page
Then I should be redirected to the Dashboard landing page
#hitting denied URL
When I access "/simon"
Then I am informed that "the page that you were looking for could not be found"
