Feature: high school college-ready student list view

As a SEA/LEA user, I want to see the high school student list view
on SLI, so I could see high school students results

Scenario: Check table headers
Given I have an open web browser
Given the server is in "test" mode
And I am authenticated to SLI as "cgray" password "cgray"
When I access "/studentlist"
And I wait for "1" seconds
When I select ed org "Dummy Ed-Org"
When I select school "Daybreak Central High"
And I select course "American Literature"
And I select section "Sec 145"
And I wait for "4" seconds
Then the table includes header "ACT"
And the table includes header "SAT"
And the table includes header "PSAT/NMSQT"
And the table includes header "Reading Test Scores (Highest)"
And the table includes header "Writing Test Scores (Highest)"
