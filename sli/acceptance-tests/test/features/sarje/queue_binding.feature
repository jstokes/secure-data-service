Given I bind to queue "search"
And I send a terminate message to the queue
And I read the queue

And I expect "Matt" to be in one of the messages written on the queue
And I expect "2a49acfb-0da9-4983-8a20-4462584f59c7_id" to be in one of the messages written on the queue
And I expect "sli.student" to be in one of the messages written on the queue
