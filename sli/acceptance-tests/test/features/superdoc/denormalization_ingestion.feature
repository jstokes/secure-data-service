Feature: As an SLI platform, I want to denormalize data to super-docs correctly when ingesting data.

  Background: I have a landing zone route configured
    Given I am using local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

  Scenario: Pre-populate the tenant to set up for subsequent scenarios
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
      | collectionName                        |
      | assessment                            |
      | recordHash                            |
      | attendance                            |
      | calendarDate                          |

    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job log has been created
    Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
