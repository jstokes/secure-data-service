Feature: As an SLI platform, I want to denormalize data to super-docs correctly when posting data.

  Background: Logged in as Illinois Daybreak IT Admin James Stevenson
    Given I am logged in using "jstevenson" "jstevenson1234" to realm "IL"
    And format "application/json"

  Scenario Outline: Check whether entity references are populated correctly in SuperDocs

    # Pre-POST check
    When I look at "<Parent ID>" in the "<Parent Collection>"
    Then I should not find "<Reference ID>" in "<Reference Field>"

    # POST
    Given a valid json document for a <Entity Type>
    When I navigate to POST "/<Entity URI>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
    And I should receive a new ID

    # Read
    When I navigate to GET "/<Entity URI>/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    # Reference should be inserted
    When I look at "<Parent ID>" in the "<Parent Collection>"
    Then I should find "<Reference ID>" in "<Reference Field>"

    # DELETE and make sure reference is also deleted
    When I navigate to DELETE "/<Entity URI>/<NEW ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
    When I navigate to GET "/<Entity URI>/<NEW ID>"
    And I should receive a return code of 404
    When I look at "<Parent ID>" in the "<Parent Collection>"
    Then I should not find "<Reference ID>" in "<Reference Field>"
