Feature: As an bulk extract user, I want to be able to get the state public entities

Scenario: As an bulk extract user, I want to initialize my database with test data.
    Given I am using local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "SEAFullDataset.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And all collections are empty
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "SEAFullDataset.zip" is completed in database
    And a batch job log has been created
    And all edorgs in "Midgar" are authorized for "SDK Sample"

 Scenario: I trigger a full bulk extract, and verify the top level edorg file has the correct private data
  Then I trigger a bulk extract
  When I fetch the path to and decrypt the LEA data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "<app id>" and edorg with id "<IL>"
  And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
   Then the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
     | entityType                            |
     | staff                                 |
     | staffCohortAssociation                |
     | staffEducationOrganizationAssociation |
     | staffProgramAssociation               |
   And I check that the "staff" extract for "IL" has "3" records
   And I verify this "staff" file should contain:
     | id                                          | condition          |
     | e4320d0bef725998faa8579a987ada80f254e7be_id | entityType = staff |
   And I verify this "staff" file should not contain:
     | id                                          |

   Scenario: Valid bulk extract user at the top level edorg can retrieve the top level edorg full private extract via the API
     Given I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "rrogers", a "Noldor" for "IL" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
     When I make a full bulk extract API call for edorg "<IL>"
     And the return code is 200 I get expected tar downloaded
     Then I check the http response headers
     When I decrypt and save the full extract
     And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
     Then the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
       | entityType                            |
       | staff                                 |

       | staffEducationOrganizationAssociation |
       | staffProgramAssociation               |

  Scenario: Valid bulk extract user not at the top level edorg cannot retrieve the top level edorg full private extract
    Given I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "jstevenson", a "Noldor" for "IL-DAYBREAK" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    When I make a full bulk extract API call for edorg "<IL>"
    And I should receive a return code of 403

  Scenario: I trigger a full bulk extract on an education organization that loses its parent
    Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
    When I remove the parent for the education organization "<IL-DAYBREAK>" for tenant "Midgar"
    Then I trigger a bulk extract
    When I fetch the path to and decrypt the LEA data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "<app id>" and edorg with id "<IL-DAYBREAK>"
    And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
    Then the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:

  Scenario: Valid bulk extract user not at the top level edorg cannot retrieve the top level edorg delta private extract
    Given I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "jstevenson", a "Noldor" for "IL-DAYBREAK" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    When I request latest delta via API for tenant "Midgar", lea "<IL>" with appId "<app id>" clientId "<client id>"
    And I should receive a return code of 403

  Scenario: As an bulk extract user, I want to initialize my database with test data.
    Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
    Given I am using local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "SEAFullDatasetDelta.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "SEAFullDatasetDelta.zip" is completed in database
    And a batch job log has been created

  Scenario: I trigger a delta bulk extract on an education organization that loses its parent
    When I remove the parent for the education organization "<IL-DAYBREAK>" for tenant "Midgar"
    Then I trigger a delta extract
  #Given I am a valid 'service' user with an authorized long-lived token "-------"
    And I request the latest bulk extract delta using the api
    And I untar and decrypt the "inBloom" delta tarfile for tenant "Midgar" and appId "<app id>" for "<IL-DAYBREAK>"
    And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
    Then the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
      | entityType                            |
      | staff                                 |
      | staffEducationOrganizationAssociation |
      | staffProgramAssociation               |
    And I check that the "staff" extract for "IL-DAYBREAK" has "4" records
    And I verify this "staff" file should contain:
      | id                                          | condition          |
