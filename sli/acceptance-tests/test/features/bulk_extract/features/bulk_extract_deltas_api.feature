  and only a delete file is generated for lea2.
  Updated two students, 1 and 12, 12 lost contextual resolution to LEA1, so it should not appear
  in the extract file.  
  1 is added to LEA2, so its stuff should go in there as well
Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
  And I am using local data store
  And I ingest "bulk_extract_deltas.zip"
  When I trigger a delta extract
     And I verify "2" delta bulk extract files are generated for LEA "<IL-DAYBREAK>" in "Midgar" 
     And I verify "2" delta bulk extract files are generated for LEA "<IL-HIGHWIND>" in "Midgar" 
     When I verify the last delta bulk extract by app "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4" for "<IL-HIGHWIND>" in "Midgar" contains a file for each of the following entities:

   And I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "jstevenson", a "IT Administrator" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds

     And The "studentAssessment" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
     And The "studentGradebookEntry" delta was extracted in the same format as the api

Scenario: Be a good neighbor and clean up before you leave
    Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
