Feature: Update data through API and retrieve through the bulk extract api end points a generated delta bulk extract file, and validate the file

  Scenario: Initialize security trust store for Bulk Extract application and LEAs
    Given the extraction zone is empty
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "<clientId>"
    And The X509 cert "cert" has been installed in the trust store and aliased
  # Make IL-DAYBREAK a charter school to verify bulk extract will work
    Given I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "jstevenson", a "IT Administrator" for "IL-DAYBREAK" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    And format "application/json"
    Then I PATCH the "organizationCategories" field of the entity specified by endpoint "educationOrganizations/1b223f577827204a1c7e9c851dba06bea6b031fe_id" to '[ "School", "Local Education Agency" ]'
