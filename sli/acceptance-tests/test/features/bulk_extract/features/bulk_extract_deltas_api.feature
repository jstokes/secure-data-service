Feature: Retrieved through the api a generated delta bulk extract file, and validate the file

Scenario: Initialize security trust store for Bulk Extract application and LEAs
  Given the extraction zone is empty
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "<clientId>"
    And The X509 cert "cert" has been installed in the trust store and aliased

Scenario: Generate a bulk extract delta after day 1 ingestion
  When I trigger a delta extract
   And I request the latest bulk extract delta using the api
   And I untar and decrypt the "inBloom" delta tarfile for tenant "Midgar" and appId "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4" for "<IL-DAYBREAK>"
  Then I should see "10" bulk extract files
   And I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "jstevenson", a "IT Administrator" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
  Then The "educationOrganization" delta was extracted in the same format as the api

  Given I trigger a bulk extract
   When I set the header format to "application/x-tar"
   Then I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "jstevenson", a "Noldor" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
   When I make lea bulk extract API call for lea "1b223f577827204a1c7e9c851dba06bea6b031fe_id"
    And the return code is 200 I get expected tar downloaded
   Then I check the http response headers
   When I decrypt and save the full extract
    And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
    And there is a metadata file in the extract
    #Then each record in the full extract is present and matches the delta extract
   #And I save some IDs from all the extract files to "delete_candidate" so I can delete them later

Scenario: Triggering deltas via ingestion
  All entities belong to lea1 which is IL-DAYBREAK, we should only see a delta file for lea1
  and only a delete file is generated for lea2.
  Updated two students, 1 and 12, 12 lost contextual resolution to LEA1, so it should not appear
  in the extract file.  
  1 is added to LEA2, so its stuff should go in there as well
  SEA - one of each of the 5 simple entities are deleted

  #this step is necesssary since there is no graduationPlan in day 0 delta, need to verify it's really the same
   #format as API would return
   And I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "jstevenson", a "IT Administrator" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
   Then The "graduationPlan" delta was extracted in the same format as the api

Scenario: Generate a bulk extract in a different LEA
  Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
    And I am using local data store

   And The "educationOrganization" delta was extracted in the same format as the api

Scenario: Ingest education organization and perform delta
  Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database

   Then I should see "2" bulk extract files
   And I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "jstevenson", a "IT Administrator" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
  Then The "educationOrganization" delta was extracted in the same format as the api

  #Combined moving school across LEA boundary scenario to test genetate a delta after another delta and
  #delta should only pick up latest change without clean bulk extract file system and database step

  #The expected behavior is that the old LEA that school used to belong to would receive an delete file, and

  And I ingested "deltas_move_between_edorg.zip" dataset
    When I trigger a delta extract

 # Now log in as lstevenson from Highwind and request the delta for Highwind
 # Should only see 1 student delta, no deletes
 Given the extract download directory is empty
   And I request the latest bulk extract delta via API for "<IL-HIGHWIND>"
   And I verify the last delta bulk extract by app "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4" for "<IL-HIGHWIND>" in "Midgar" contains a file for each of the following entities:
    |  entityType                            |
    |  student                               |
    |  studentSchoolAssociation              |
    |  deleted                               |
  And I verify this "student" file should contain:

  And I verify this "studentSchoolAssociation" file should contain:

Scenario: Test access to the api
  Given I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "lstevenson", a "Noldor" for "IL-Highwind" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
  And I request latest delta via API for tenant "Midgar", lea "<IL-HIGHWIND>" with appId "<app id>" clientId "<client id>"
  Then I should receive a return code of 200

Scenario: Be a good neighbor and clean up before you leave
    Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
