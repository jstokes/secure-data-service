Feature: Retrived through the api a generated delta bulk extract file, and validate the file

Scenario: Initialize security trust store for Bulk Extract application and LEAs
  Given I have an empty bulk extract files collection
    And The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "<clientId>"
    And The X509 cert "cert" has been installed in the trust store and aliased

Scenario: Generate a bulk extract day 0 delta    
  When inBloom generates a bulk extract delta file
   And I request the latest bulk extract delta using the api
   And I untar and decrypt the delta tarfile for tenant "Midgar" and appId "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
     Then I should see "2" bulk extract files
   And I log into "inBloom Dashboards" with a token of "jstevenson", a "IT Administrator" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    Then The "educationOrganization" delta was extracted in the same format as the api

Scenario: Generate a bulk extract in a different LEAs
  Given the extraction zone is empty
    And I have an empty delta collection
    And I have an empty bulk extract files collection
    And I am using local data store
    And I post "deltas_new_edorg_wrong_lea.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job

  When the landing zone for tenant "Midgar" edOrg "Daybreak" is reinitialized
   And zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
   And a batch job for file "deltas_new_edorg_wrong_lea.zip" is completed in database
   And a batch job log has been created 
    Then I should not see an error log file created
     And I should not see a warning log file created

  When inBloom generates a bulk extract delta file
   And I request the latest bulk extract delta using the api
   And I untar and decrypt the delta tarfile for tenant "Midgar" and appId "<cert>"
   Then I should see "1" bulk extract files
   And I log into "inBloom Dashboards" with a token of "jstevenson", a "IT Administrator" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    Then The "educationOrganization" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
     And The "educationOrganization" entity with id "<ed_org_to_lea2_id>" should belong to LEA with id "<lea2_id>" 

Scenario: Ingest education organization and perform delta   
  Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
    And I am using local data store
    And I post "deltas_new_edorg.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job

  When the landing zone for tenant "Midgar" edOrg "Daybreak" is reinitialized
   And zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
   And a batch job for file "deltas_new_edorg.zip" is completed in database
   And a batch job log has been created 
    Then I should not see an error log file created
     And I should not see a warning log file created

  When inBloom generates a bulk extract delta file
    And I untar and decrypt the delta tarfile for tenant "Midgar" and appId "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
      Then I should see "1" bulk extract files
    And I log into "inBloom Dashboards" with a token of "jstevenson", a "IT Administrator" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    Then The "educationOrganization" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
     And The "school" delta was extracted in the same format as the api

Scenario: Ingest SEA update and verify no deltas generated
  Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
    And I am using local data store
    And I post "deltas_update_sea.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job

  When the landing zone for tenant "Midgar" edOrg "Daybreak" is reinitialized
   And zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
   And a batch job for file "deltas_update_sea.zip" is completed in database
   And a batch job log has been created 
    Then I should not see an error log file created
     And I should not see a warning log file created

  When inBloom generates a bulk extract delta file
    Then there should be no deltas

Scenario: Log in to the API and authenticate with the Bulk Extract ClientID
Given I log into "inBloom Dashboards" with a token of "jstevenson", a "IT Administrator" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
  And format "application/vnd.slc+json"
    When I POST an entity of type "educationOrganization"
      Then I should receive a return code of 201   
  When inBloom generates a bulk extract delta file
   And I untar and decrypt the delta tarfile for tenant "Midgar" and appId "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
     Then I should see "1" bulk extract files
      And The "educationOrganization" delta was extracted in the same format as the api

@wip
Scenario: Update an existing education organization through the API and perform delta
Given format "application/json"
  When I "POST" a "update" entity of type "educationOrganization"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200

  When inBloom generates a bulk extract delta file
   And I log in to the inBloom dashboards as "jstevenson" and get a token
   And I request the latest bulk extract delta
   And I untar and decrypt the tarfile with cert "<cert>"

  Then I should see "1" entities of type "educationOrganization" in the bulk extract deltas tarfile
   And a "educationOrganization" was extracted in the same format as the api
   And each extracted "educationOrganization" delta matches the mongo entry

@wip
Scenario: Update an existing education organization with an invalid API call
Given format "application/json"
  When I "PUT" a "invalid" entity of type "educationOrganization"
    Then I should receive a return code of 404

  When inBloom generates a bulk extract delta file
   And I log in to the inBloom dashboards as "jstevenson" and get a token
   And I request the latest bulk extract delta
   And I untar and decrypt the tarfile with cert "<cert>"

  Then I should see "0" entities of type "educationOrganization" in the bulk extract deltas tarfile
   And a "educationOrganization" was extracted in the same format as the api
   And each extracted "educationOrganization" delta matches the mongo entry
