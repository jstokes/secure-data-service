Feature: Retrived through the api a generated delta bulk extract file, and validate the file

Scenario: Initialize security trust store for Bulk Extract application and LEAs
  Given the extraction zone is empty
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "<clientId>"
    And The X509 cert "cert" has been installed in the trust store and aliased

Scenario: Generate a bulk extract delta after day 0 ingestion
  When I trigger a delta extract
   And I request the latest bulk extract delta using the api
   And I untar and decrypt the "inBloom" delta tarfile for tenant "Midgar" and appId "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4" for "<IL-DAYBREAK>"
  Then I should see "8" bulk extract files
   And I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "jstevenson", a "IT Administrator" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
  Then The "educationOrganization" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "parent" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "studentParentAssociation" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "section" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "gradebookEntry" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "studentSectionAssociation" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "staff" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "teacher" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "teacherSectionAssociation" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "teacherSchoolAssociation" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "staffEducationOrganizationAssociation" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "grade" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "reportCard" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "studentAcademicRecord" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "attendance" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "student" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "studentSchoolAssociation" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "studentAssessment" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "studentGradebookEntry" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "cohort" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "studentCohortAssociation" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "staffCohortAssociation" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "session" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "gradingPeriod" delta was extracted in the same format as the api
   And The "courseOffering" delta was extracted in the same format as the api

Scenario: Triggering deltas via ingestion
  All entities belong to lea1 which is IL-DAYBREAK, we should only see a delta file for lea1
  and only a delete file is generated for lea2.
  Updated two students, 1 and 12, 12 lost contextual resolution to LEA1, so it should not appear
  in the extract file.  
  1 is added to LEA2, so its stuff should go in there as well
Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
  And I am using local data store
  And I ingest "bulk_extract_deltas.zip"
  When I trigger a delta extract
     And I verify "2" delta bulk extract files are generated for LEA "<IL-DAYBREAK>" in "Midgar" 
     And I verify "2" delta bulk extract files are generated for LEA "<IL-HIGHWIND>" in "Midgar" 
     When I verify the last delta bulk extract by app "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4" for "<IL-HIGHWIND>" in "Midgar" contains a file for each of the following entities:

Scenario: Generate a bulk extract in a different LEA
  Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database

  When the landing zone for tenant "Midgar" edOrg "Daybreak" is reinitialized
   And zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
   And a batch job for file "deltas_new_edorg_wrong_lea.zip" is completed in database
   And a batch job log has been created 
  Then I should not see an error log file created
   And I should not see a warning log file created

  When I trigger a delta extract
   And I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "rrogers", a "Noldor" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
   #And I am a valid 'service' user with an authorized long-lived token "92FAD560-D2AF-4EC1-A2CC-F15B460E1E43"

   And I should receive a return code of 200
   #And I untar and decrypt the "inBloom" delta tarfile for tenant "Midgar" and appId "<app id>" for "<IL-HIGHWIND>"

 When I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "jstevenson", a "Noldor" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
  And I generate and retrieve the bulk extract delta via API for "<IL-DAYBREAK>"
  And I verify the last delta bulk extract by app "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4" for "<IL-DAYBREAK>" in "Midgar" contains a file for each of the following entities:
        |  entityType                            |
        |  student                               |
