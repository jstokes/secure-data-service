Feature: Retrieved through the api a generated delta bulk extract file, and validate the file

Scenario: Initialize security trust store for Bulk Extract application and LEAs
  Given the extraction zone is empty
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "<clientId>"
    And The X509 cert "cert" has been installed in the trust store and aliased    
    # Make IL-DAYBREAK a charter school to verify bulk extract will work
    Given I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "jstevenson", a "IT Administrator" for "IL-DAYBREAK" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    And format "application/json"
    Then I PATCH the "organizationCategories" field of the entity specified by endpoint "educationOrganizations/1b223f577827204a1c7e9c851dba06bea6b031fe_id" to '[ "School", "Local Education Agency" ]'

Scenario: Triggering deltas via ingestion
  All entities belong to lea1 which is IL-DAYBREAK, we should only see a delta file for lea1
  and only a delete file is generated for lea2.
  Updated two students, 1 and 12, 12 lost contextual resolution to LEA1, so it should not appear
  in the extract file.
  1 is added to LEA2, so its stuff should go in there as well
