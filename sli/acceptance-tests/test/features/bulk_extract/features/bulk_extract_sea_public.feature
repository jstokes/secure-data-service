Feature: As an bulk extract user, I want to be able to get the state public entities


Scenario: As a valid user unsuccessful attempt to get public data extract using BEEP when extract has not been triggered
    Given The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "<clientId>"
    And The X509 cert "cert" has been installed in the trust store and aliased
    And the extraction zone is empty
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
    When I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "rrogers", a "Noldor" for "IL" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/public"
    Then I get back a response code of "404"

Scenario: As an bulk extract user, I want to be able to get the state public entities
    Given the extraction zone is empty
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    Then I remove the edorg with id "IL-Test" from the "Midgar" database
    Then I trigger a bulk extract
    Then I should see "1" bulk extract SEA-public data file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    When I retrieve the path to and decrypt the SEA public data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
    And there is a metadata file in the extract
    And the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
      |  entityType                            |

Scenario Outline: Extract should have all public tenant data for certain entities
    When I retrieve the path to and decrypt the SEA public data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
   And a the correct number of "<entity>" was extracted from the database

Scenario: As a valid user get public data delta extract using BEEP
  Given in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
  When I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "rrogers", a "Noldor" for "IL" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
  When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/public/delta/2013-04-30T17:22:26.391Z"
  Then I get back a response code of "404"

  Scenario: API call to the SEA BEEP with an invalid edOrg
  Given in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
  When I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "rrogers", a "Noldor" for "IL" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
  When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/bdb4be44075c7e7d1a7b066c81ff338ed1936_id"
  Then I get back a response code of "403"

Scenario: API call to the SEA BEEP with a non SEA but valid EdOrg
  Given in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
  When I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "rrogers", a "Noldor" for "IL" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
  When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/772a61c687ee7ecd8e6d9ad3369f7883409f803b_id"
  Then I get back a response code of "200"

Scenario: Invalid user tries to access public data
    Given I am a valid 'service' user with an authorized long-lived token "438e472e-a888-46d1-8087-0195f4e37089"
    And in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
    When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/public"
    When I get back a response code of "403"


Scenario: SEA public data delta extract using BEEP with invalid users
  Given in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
  When I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "linda.kim", a "Teacher" for "IL-DAYBREAK" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
  When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/public/delta/2013-04-30T17:22:26.391Z"
  Then I get back a response code of "403"

Scenario: Bulk extract should not fail if there is more than 1 SEA in the tenant.
    Given I am using local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "ExtendedSEA.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "ExtendedSEA.zip" is completed in database
    Then a batch job log has been created
    Given the extraction zone is empty
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    Then I trigger a bulk extract
    Then I should see "1" bulk extract SEA-public data file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"

Scenario: API call to SEA BEEP when there is more than one SEA in the tenant

  When I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "rrogers", a "Noldor" for "IL" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
  When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/public"
  Then I get back a response code of "200"
  Then I remove the edorg with id "IL-Test" from the "Midgar" database

  Scenario: A public data extract can be retrieved from the api by a user with the BULK_EXTRACT right when the app is approved only for the SEA
    Given in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And The bulk extract app hasn't been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    And The bulk extract app has been approved for "IL" with client id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    And I trigger a bulk extract
    And I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "rrogers", a "Noldor" for "IL" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    And I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/public"
    Then the return code is 200 I get expected tar downloaded
    And I decrypt and save the extracted file
    And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
    And there is a metadata file in the extract
    And the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:

  Scenario: Where the public entity has no edOrg reference, verify the entity is still extracted for the SEA
    Given the extraction zone is empty
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    And I get the SEA Id for the tenant "Midgar"
    #removes entries from the collection referencing SEA
    # not possible to have calenderDate with blank edOrg, those with SEA go to SEA, those not associated to SEA go to LEA
    And none of the following entities reference the SEA:
      | entity                                 | path                                   |

    Then I trigger a bulk extract
