Feature: As an bulk extract user, I want to be able to get the state public entities


Scenario: As a valid user unsuccessful attempt to get SEA public data extract using BEEP when extract has not been triggered
    Given The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "<clientId>"
    And The X509 cert "cert" has been installed in the trust store and aliased
    And the extraction zone is empty
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
    When I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "rrogers", a "Noldor" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/b64ee2bcc92805cdd8ada6b7d8f9c643c9459831_id"
    Then I get back a response code of "404"

Scenario: As an bulk extract user, I want to be able to get the state public entities
    Given the extraction zone is empty
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    Then I remove the edorg with id "IL-Test" from the "Midgar" database
    Then I trigger a bulk extract
    Then I should see "1" bulk extract SEA-public data file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    When I retrieve the path to and decrypt the SEA public data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
    And there is a metadata file in the extract
    And the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
      |  entityType                            |
      |  course                                |
      |  courseOffering                        |
      |  educationOrganization                 |
      |  graduationPlan                        |
      |  school                                |
      |  session                               |
      |  assessment                            |
      |  learningObjective                     |
      |  learningStandard                      |

      |  program                               |
      |  gradingPeriod                         |

Scenario Outline: Extract should have all the valid data for the SEA
    When I retrieve the path to and decrypt the SEA public data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
  Then the "<entity>" has the correct number of SEA public data records "<field>"
  And I verify that the "<entity>" reference an SEA only "<field>"
    Examples:
      | entity                         |    field                                |
      |  course                        |    schoolId                             |
      |  courseOffering                |    schoolId                             |
      |  educationOrganization         |    parentEducationAgencyReference       |
      |  graduationPlan                |    educationOrganizationId              |
      |  school                        |    parentEducationAgencyReference       |
      |  session                       |    schoolId                             |
      |  gradingPeriod                 |    gradingPeriodIdentity.schoolId       |

Scenario: Extract should contain graduationPlans that do not reference any EdOrg
    When I retrieve the path to and decrypt the SEA public data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
   Then I verify that 1 "graduationPlan" does not contain the reference field "educationOrganizationId"

Scenario Outline: Extract should have all public tenant data for certain entities
    When I retrieve the path to and decrypt the SEA public data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
   And a the correct number of "<entity>" was extracted from the database
   And a "<entity>" was extracted with all the correct fields

   Examples:
      | entity                                 |
      |  assessment                            |
      |  learningObjective                     |

    When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/b64ee2bcc92805cdd8ada6b7d8f9c643c9459831_id"
    And the return code is 200 I get expected tar downloaded
    And I decrypt and save the extracted file
    And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
    And there is a metadata file in the extract
    And the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
      |  entityType                            |

Scenario Outline: Extract received through the API should have all the valid data for the SEA
    When I know where the extracted tar is for tenant "Midgar"
    Then the "<entity>" has the correct number of SEA public data records "<field>"
    And I verify that the "<entity>" reference an SEA only "<field>"
  Examples:
    | entity                         |    field                                |

Scenario Outline: Extract received through the API should have all the valid tenant public data
    When I know where the extracted tar is for tenant "Midgar"
   And a the correct number of "<entity>" was extracted from the database
   And a "<entity>" was extracted with all the correct fields
   Examples:
      | entity                                 |
