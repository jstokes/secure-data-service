Feature: A bulk extract is triggered for the student entity

Scenario: Verify a student was correctly extracted
   When I retrieve the path to the extract file for the tenant "Midgar"
   And a "student" extract file exists
   And a the correct number of "student" was extracted from the database
   And a "student" was extracted with all the correct fields
   And I log into "inBloom Dashboards" with a token of "jstevenson", a "IT Administrator" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
   Then a "student" was extracted in the same format as the api
