Feature: A bulk extract is triggered

@smoke
Scenario: Trigger a bulk extract on ingested data
   Given I trigger a bulk extract
   When I fetch the path to and decrypt the LEA data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4" and edorg with id "1b223f577827204a1c7e9c851dba06bea6b031fe_id"
   And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
   And there is a metadata file in the extract
   And the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
   |  entityType                            |
