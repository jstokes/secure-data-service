Feature: BEEP will log security events for each request

Background:
    Given the sli securityEvent collection is empty

Scenario: An authorized bulk extract user logs in and gets the information for the extract from a HEAD call
    Given I am using local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    Given I am a valid 'service' user with an authorized long-lived token "92FAD560-D2AF-4EC1-A2CC-F15B460E1E43"
    Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
    And I post "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak.zip" is completed in database
    And in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
    Then I trigger a bulk extract
    And I post "ExtendStaffEdorgAssociation.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "ExtendStaffEdorgAssociation.zip" is completed in database
    And I check to find if record is in collection:
      | collectionName              			   | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter     | searchValue                                 | searchType           |
      | staffEducationOrganizationAssociation   | 3                   | body.staffReference | e4320d0bef725998faa8579a987ada80f254e7be_id | string               |
    Then I trigger a delta extract

  Scenario: Security Event is logged when I retrieve LEA data
    Given in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
    When I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "rrogers", a "Noldor" for "IL" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/LEA_DAYBREAK_ID"
    When I get back a response code of "200"
    Then a security event matching "Received request to stream Edorg data" should be in the sli db
    Then a security event matching "Successful request for singlePartFileResponse" should be in the sli db

  Scenario: Security Event is logged when I attempt to retrieve a bulk extract for a non-bulk extract application
    Given I update the "application" with ID "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4" field "body.isBulkExtract" to "false" on the sli database
    And in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
    When I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "rrogers", a "Noldor" for "IL" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    Given the sli securityEvent collection is empty
    When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/list"
    Then I get back a response code of "403"
       And I should see a count of "2" in the security event collection
       And I check to find if record is in sli db collection:
         | collectionName  | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter         | searchValue                                                | searchType |

       And "2" security event with field "body.actionUri" matching "http.*/api/rest/v1.3/bulk/extract/list" should be in the sli db
    Given I update the "application" with ID "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4" field "body.isBulkExtract" to "true" on the sli database
