Feature: An edorg's extract file should contain student and staff data from previous enrollments with other schools

  Scenario: Setup the database and trigger an extract
    Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
    And I am using local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I successfully ingest "PriorDataSetDeltas.zip"
    And all edorgs in "Midgar" are authorized for "SDK Sample"
    And I trigger a delta extract

  Scenario: The extract for an edorg should contain data for a student or staff from a previously enrolled school
    And I request the latest bulk extract delta using the api
    And I untar and decrypt the "inBloom" delta tarfile for tenant "Midgar" and appId "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4" for "897755cae2f689c2d565a35a48ea69d5dd3928d6_id"
    And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
    Then the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
      | entityType                            |
      | student                               |

  Scenario: The extract for an edorg should not contain data for a former student or staff that's dated after the person has left
    And I request the latest bulk extract delta using the api
