Feature: cron job scheduler for bulk-extracts

# TODO: Do something with this piece of junk that will not run in CI
#Scenario: Configure bulk extract scheduler
#  Given I configurate the bulk extract scheduler script
#  And I clean up the cron extraction zone
#  When I run the bulk extract scheduler script
#  Then I am willing to wait up to 90 seconds for the bulk extract scheduler cron job to start and complete
#  And I clean up the scheduler jobs
