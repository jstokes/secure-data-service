Feature: As an bulk extract user, I want to be able to get the state public entities


Scenario: As a valid user unsuccessful attempt to get public data extract using BEEP when extract has not been triggered
    Given The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "<clientId>"
    And The X509 cert "cert" has been installed in the trust store and aliased
    And the extraction zone is empty
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
    When I log into "SDK Sample" with a token of "rrogers", a "Noldor" for "IL" for "IL-Daybreak" in tenant "Midgar", that lasts for "300" seconds
    When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/public"
    Then I get back a response code of "404"

Scenario: As an bulk extract user, I want to be able to get the state public entities
    Given the extraction zone is empty
    And the bulk extract files in the database are scrubbed
    And The bulk extract app has been approved for "Midgar-DAYBREAK" with client id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    Then I remove the edorg with id "IL-Test" from the "Midgar" database
    Then I trigger a bulk extract
    Then I should see "1" bulk extract public data file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    When I retrieve the path to and decrypt the public data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
    And there is a metadata file in the extract
    And the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
