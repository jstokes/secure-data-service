Feature: A bulk extract is triggered and simple one-to-one entities are verified

Scenario Outline: Verify simple entities were correctly extracted for LEA
   When I get the path to the extract file for the tenant "<tenant>" and application with id "<appId>" for the lea "1b223f577827204a1c7e9c851dba06bea6b031fe_id"
   And a "<entity>" extract file exists
   And a the correct number of "<entity>" was extracted from the database
   And a "<entity>" was extracted with all the correct fields
   And I log into "inBloom Dashboards" with a token of "<user>", a "<role>" for "<edorg>" for "<realm>" in tenant "<tenant>", that lasts for "300" seconds
   Then a "<entity>" was extracted in the same format as the api
   
	Examples:
    | entity                                | user       | role             | realm       | tenant | edorg        | appId                                |
