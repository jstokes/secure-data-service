Feature: As an API user, I want to be able to get a list of links available to the user.

  Background: Validate that the multi-parents entity is extracted correctly
	Given I am using local data store
	And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"

  Scenario: Validate that the multi-parents School entity is extracted correctly with full bulk extract
    Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
    And I post "SmallSampleDataSet-Charter.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
      | collectionName                            |

    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "SmallSampleDataSet-Charter.zip" is completed in database
    And I check to find if record is in collection:
      | collectionName              			   | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter     | searchValue                                 | searchType           |

    And in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
    Then I trigger a bulk extract
    When I retrieve the path to and decrypt the LEA "<IL-DAYBREAK school>" public data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
    And there is a metadata file in the extract
    And the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:

    And I check to find if record is in collection:
      | collectionName              			   | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter     | searchValue                                 | searchType           |
      | educationOrganization                      | 1                   | body.charterStatus  | School Charter                              | string               |
    And in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
    Then I trigger a delta extract
    When I verify the last delta bulk extract by app "<app id>" for "<IL-DAYBREAK school>" in "Midgar" contains a file for each of the following entities:
