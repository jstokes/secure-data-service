Feature: An edorg's extract file should contain student data from previous enrollments with other schools

  Scenario: Setup the database and trigger an extract
    Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
    And I am using local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And all collections are empty
    And I successfully ingest "PriorDataSet.zip"
    And all edorgs in "Midgar" are authorized for "SDK Sample"
    And I trigger an extract for tenant "Midgar"

  Scenario: The extract for an edorg should contain data for a student from a previously enrolled school
    When I fetch the path to and decrypt the LEA data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4" and edorg with id "897755cae2f689c2d565a35a48ea69d5dd3928d6_id"
    And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
    Then the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
      | entityType                            |
      | attendance                            |
