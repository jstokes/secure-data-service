Feature: An edorg's extract file should contain student data from previous enrollments with other schools

  Scenario: Generate with expired data set using Odin generate tool
    Given I am using the odin working directory
    When I generate the with expired data set in the generated directory
    And I zip generated data under filename OdinSampleDataSet.zip to the new OdinSampleDataSet directory
    And I copy generated data to the new OdinSampleDataSet directory
    Then I should see generated file <File>
      | File  |
      |ControlFile.ctl|
      |InterchangeAssessmentMetadata.xml|
      |InterchangeAttendance.xml|
      |InterchangeEducationOrgCalendar.xml|
      |InterchangeEducationOrganization.xml|
      |InterchangeMasterSchedule.xml|
      |InterchangeStaffAssociation.xml|
      |InterchangeStudentAssessment.xml|
      |InterchangeStudentCohort.xml|
      |InterchangeStudentDiscipline.xml|
      |InterchangeStudentEnrollment.xml|
      |InterchangeStudentGrades.xml|
      |InterchangeStudentParent.xml|
      |InterchangeStudentProgram.xml|
      |OdinSampleDataSet.zip|

  Scenario: Setup the database and trigger an extract
    Given I clean the bulk extract file system and database
    And I am using odin data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And all collections are empty
    And I post "OdinSampleDataSet.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "OdinSampleDataSet.zip" is completed in database

    Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
      | collectionName                           |              count|
      | student                                  |                204|
    And I should not see an error log file created
    And I should not see a warning log file created

  Scenario: The extract for an edorg should contain data for a student from a previously enrolled school
    Given all edorgs in "Midgar" are authorized for "SDK Sample"
    And I trigger an extract for tenant "Midgar"
    When I fetch the path to and decrypt the LEA data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4" and edorg with id "897755cae2f689c2d565a35a48ea69d5dd3928d6_id"
    And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
    Then the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
      | entityType                            |
      | attendance                            |

  Scenario: The extract for an edorg should not contain data for a former student that's dated after the student has left
