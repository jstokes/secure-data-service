Feature: A bulk extract is triggered, retrieved through the api, and validated
@wip
Scenario: Trigger a bulk extract on ingested data and retrieve the extract through the api
   Given I trigger a bulk extract
   And I am a valid 'service' user with an authorized long-lived token "92FAD560-D2AF-4EC1-A2CC-F15B460E1E43"
   And in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
  #When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/tenant"
  #Then I should receive a return code of 403
  When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/LEA_DAYBREAK_ID"
   When the return code is 200 I get expected tar downloaded
   Then I check the http response headers
   When I decrypt and save the extracted file
   And I verify that an extract tar file was created for the tenant "Midgar"
   And there is a metadata file in the extract
   And the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
   |  entityType                            |

Scenario: Un-Authorized user cannot use the endpoint
        Given I am logged in using "linda.kim" "balrogs" to realm "IL"
        When I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/LEA_DAYBREAK_ID"
        Then I should receive a return code of 403

Scenario: Validate the Last-Modified header is in a valid http date format
    #Retrieve file information
    When I retrieve the path to and decrypt the LEA public data extract file for the tenant "Midgar" and application with id "19cca28d-7357-4044-8df9-caad4b1c8ee4"
    When I know the file-length of the extract file

    #Make a head call to retrieve last-modified information
    Given I am a valid 'service' user with an authorized long-lived token "92FAD560-D2AF-4EC1-A2CC-F15B460E1E43"
    And in my list of rights I have BULK_EXTRACT
    When I make a call retrieve the header for the bulk extract end point "/bulk/extract/LEA_DAYBREAK_ID"
    Then I get back a response code of "200"
    Then I have all the information to make a custom bulk extract request

    #Make a bulk extract request with correct If-Unmodified-Since time based on last-modified
    When the If-Unmodified-Since header field is set to "BEFORE"
    And I make a custom bulk extract API call
    Then I get back a response code of "412"

Scenario: Verify the cleanup script correctly deletes the files and database entries
  When I execute cleanup script for tenant:"Midgar", edorg:"", date:"", path:""
  Then I should not see an extract for tenant "Midgar"

Scenario: Leave an extract for following tests
  Given I trigger a bulk extract
