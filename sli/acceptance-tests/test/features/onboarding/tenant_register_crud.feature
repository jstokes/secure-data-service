Feature: Tenant Registration Entity
As an administrator for SLI, I want to create a tenant entity so that it listen for files on landing zone

Scenario: CRUD operations on Tenants

    Given I am logged in using "developer" "developer1234" to realm "SLI"
    When I POST a new tenant
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
    And I should receive an ID for the newly created tenant
    When I rePOST the new tenant
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
    And I should receive the same tenant id
    When I navigate to GET "/tenants/<New Tenant ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    And I should receive the data for the specified tenant entry
    When I navigate to PUT "/tenants/<New Tenant ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
    When I navigate to DELETE "/tenants/<New Tenant ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
    And I should no longer be able to get that tenant's data
