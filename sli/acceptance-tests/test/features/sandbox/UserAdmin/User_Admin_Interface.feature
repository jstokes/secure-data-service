Background: 
Given I have an open web browser
And LDAP server has been setup and running

@sandbox 
Scenario Outline:  As a sandbox admin I am able to read all admin accounts in my tenancy on sandbox
When I navigate to the sandbox user account management page
Then I will be redirected to "Simple" login page
When I submit the credentials "<USER>" "<PASSWORD>" for the "Simple" login page
And I hit the sandbox user account management app list all users page
Then I see a table with headings of "Full Name" and "Email" and "Role" and "EdOrg" and "Date Created" and "Actions"
Then I see a user with Full Name is "<USER_FULL_NAME>" in the table
Then the user "email" is "<USER_EMAIL>"
#Then the user "role" is "<USER_ROLE>"
#Then the user "edorg" is "<USER_EDORG>"
   

  Examples:
    |USER                 |PASSWORD                 |USER_FULL_NAME       |USER_EMAIL                     |USER_ROLE              |USER_TENANT                      |USER_EDORG        |
