Scenario Outline:  As a sandbox admin I am able to read all admin accounts in my tenancy on sandbox
When I navigate to the sandbox user account management page
Then I will be redirected to "Simple" login page
When I submit the credentials "<USER>" "<PASSWORD>" for the "Simple" login page
And I hit the sandbox user account management app list all users page

Then the user "Email" is "<USER_EMAIL>"
Then the user "Role" is "<USER_ROLE>"
Then the user "EdOrg" is "<USER_EDORG>"
