Then the Ingestion Admin is authenticated to Simple IDP as user "<USERID>" with pass "<PASSWORD>"
When the Ingestion Admin provision a Landing zone
Then the user gets an error message

@sandbox
Scenario: As a developer I can use the provisioning tool to create a LZ for my sandbox tenancy
Given there is an sandbox account in ldap
And the account has a tenantId "<DEVELOPER_EMAIL>"
#And the account has a edorg of "<SANDBOX_EDORG>"
And there is no corresponding tenant in mongo
When the developer go to the provisioning application web page

@sandbox
Scenario: As an developer I can use the provisioning tool to switch between LZ
Given there is an sandbox account in ldap

Scenario: As a developer I can use the provisioning tool to pre-populate my tenant with a sample data set
Given there is an sandbox account in ldap
And the account has a tenantId "<DEVELOPER_EMAIL>"
And there is no corresponding tenant in mongo
When the developer go to the provisioning application web page
Then the developer is authenticated to Simple IDP as user "<USERID>" with pass "<PASSWORD>"
When the developer go to the provisioning application web page
When the developer selects to preload "Small Dataset"
Then a tenant with tenantId "<DEVELOPER_EMAIL>" created in Mongo
And a request to provision a landing zone is made
And the directory structure for the landing zone is stored in ldap
And the directory structure for the landing zone is stored for tenant in mongo
And the "small" data to preload is stored for the tenant in mongo
And the user gets a success message indicating preloading has been triggered
Then "20" seconds have elapsed
When the tenant with tenantId "<DEVELOPER_EMAIL>" is locked
When the developer go to the provisioning application web page
When the developer selects to preload "Small Dataset"
Then the user gets an error message
And the tenant with tenantId "<DEVELOPER_EMAIL>" is unlocked
Then "5" seconds have elapsed
And I go to my landing zone
Then a batch job log has been created
And I should not see an error log file created
And correct number of records should be ingested for "SmallSampleDataSet.zip"
Then "10" seconds have elapsed
And I clean the landing zone
And user's landing zone is still provisioned from the prior preloading of "Small Dataset"
When the developer go to the provisioning application web page
And the developer selects to preload "Small Dataset"
Then the "small" data to preload is stored for the tenant in mongo
And the user gets a success message indicating preloading has been triggered
Then "10" seconds have elapsed
And I go to my landing zone
Then a batch job log has been created
And I should not see an error log file created
And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
