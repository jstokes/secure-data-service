Scenario: App makes an api call to retrieve a bulk extract delta
#Get a session to trigger a bulk extract
Given the pre-existing bulk extrac testing app key has been created
  When I navigate to the API authorization endpoint with my client ID
   And I select "Daybreak Test Realm" and click go
   And I was redirected to the "Simple" IDP Login page
  When I submit the credentials "jstevenson" "jstevenson1234" for the "Simple" login page
  Then I should receive a json response containing my authorization code
  When I navigate to the API token endpoint with my client ID, secret, authorization code, and redirect URI
  Then I should receive a json response containing my authorization token
   And there is no bulk extract files in the local directory

  Then I get the id for the edorg "IL-DAYBREAK"
  When I PATCH the endDate for the staffProgramAssociation entity to 2011-05-05
  Then I should receive a return code of 204
  When the operator triggers a delta for the production tenant
   #And I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/v1.1/bulk/extract/list"
   And I make a call to the bulk extract end point "/v1.1/bulk/extract/list" using the certificate for app "pike"
   And I get back a response code of "200"
   And I store the URL for the latest delta for the LEA
   And the number of returned URLs is correct:
   |   fieldName  | count |
   |   fullEdOrgs   |  1    |
   |   deltaEdOrgs  |  1    |
   And I request and download a "delta" extract file for the edorg
   And there is a metadata file in the extract
   And the extract contains a file for each of the following entities:
   |  entityType                            |
   |  student                               |

Scenario: Ingestion user ingests additional public entities
  Given a landing zone
  And I drop the file "NewSimplePublicEntities.zip" into the landingzone
  And I check for the file "job-NewSimplePublicEntities*.log" every "6" seconds for "120" seconds
  Then I should not see an error log file created
  And I should not see a warning log file created

  Scenario: SEA admin makes an api call to PATCH the SEA

    And I was redirected to the "Simple" IDP Login page
    When I submit the credentials "rrogers" "rrogers1234" for the "Simple" login page
    Then I should receive a json response containing my authorization code
    When I navigate to the API token endpoint with my client ID, secret, authorization code, and redirect URI
    Then I should receive a json response containing my authorization token
    And I get the id for the edorg "STANDARD-SEA"
    When I PATCH the postalCode for the current edorg entity to 99999
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
