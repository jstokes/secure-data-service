Feature: User provisions a landing zone, and preloads Small Sample Dataset

Background:
  Given I have an open web browser
  And I am running in Sandbox mode

  Scenario: Ingestion User Provisions LZ and Pre-loads Small Sample Dataset
	When I navigate to the Portal home page
	And I was redirected to the "Simple" IDP Login page
	When I submit the credentials "<DEVELOPER_SB_EMAIL>" "<DEVELOPER_SB_EMAIL_PASS>" for the "Simple" login page  
    Then I should be on Portal home page
    Then I should see Admin link
    And I click on Admin
    Then I should be on the admin page
    And under System Tools, I click on "Create Landing Zone"
    And I switch to the iframe
    When the developer selects to preload "Small Dataset"
    And I switch to the iframe
    Then I get the success message

#Verify the file ingested on the Landing Zone
    Given a landing zone
    And I check for the file "job*.log" every "30" seconds for "900" seconds
    Then the "SmallSampleDataSet.zip" should be ingested with the correct number of records
    And the landing zone should contain a file with the message "All records processed successfully."
    And I should not see an error log file created
    And I should not see a warning log file created
    And I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
