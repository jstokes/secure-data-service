Feature: As a teacher I want to get DIBELS Composite Score and Reading Level

Background: None


Scenario Outline:  (sorting) As a teacher, for my class, I want to get the most recent DIBELS assessment
    Given  I am a valid SEA/LEA end user <Username> with password <Password>
    And I have a Role attribute returned from the "SEA/LEA IDP"
    And the role attribute equals <AnyDefaultSLIRole>
    And I am authenticated on "SEA/LEA IDP"

     Given format "application/json"
	When I navigate to GET "/teachers/<'Ms. Jones' ID>"
	Then I should receive a link named "getTeacherSectionAssociations" with URI "/teacher-section-associations/<'Ms. Jones' ID>"

		And I should receive a link named "self" with URI "/teachers/<'Ms. Jones' ID>"
		
	When I navigate to "getSections" with URI "/teacher-section-associations/<'Ms. Jones' ID>/targets"
	Then I should receive a collection of 2 section links 
		And I should find section with uniqueSectionCode is "Section I" 
		And I should find section with uniqueSectionCode is "Section II"  with <'ImportantSection' ID>
				
	When I navigate to "getAssessments" with URI "/section-assessment-associations/<'ImportantSection' ID>/targets" with filter sorting and pagination

	     Then  I should receive a collection of 1 assessment link
	        And I should find Assessment with "<'Grade 2 MOY DIBELS' ID>"
        
	When I navigate to GET "/assessments/<'Grade 2 MOY DIBELS' ID>"
	    Then I should receive 1 assessment

	 When I navigate to GET "/student-section-associations/<'ImportantSection' ID>/targets"

		And I should find Student with <'Suzy Queue' ID>
		And I should find Student with <'Mary Line' ID>
	 	And I should find Student with <'Dong Steve' ID>
	 
	 Given I loop through the collection of student links
	 When for each student, I navigate to GET "/student-assessment-associations/<'Grade 2 MOY DIBELS' ID>" with filter sorting and pagination

		 Then for each student, I should receive a collection of 1 studentAssessmentAssociation link 
		  And for each student, I should receive a "student-assessment-association" with ID "<'Most Recent Assessment Association' ID>"
	     
	  When for each student, I navigate to URI /student-assessment-associations/"<'Most Recent Assessment Association' ID>"
	     Then for each student, I get 1 student-assessment-association
			    	 And for each student, the "administrationDate" is "2012-01-10"
