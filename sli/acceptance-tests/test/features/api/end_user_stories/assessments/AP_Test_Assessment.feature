@wip
Scenario Outline:  As a leader I want to get the following attrubutes for all the students in my school, AP English Score, AP Calculus Score, AP US History Score
    Given  I am valid SEA/LEA end user <Username> with password <Password>
    And I have a Role attribute returned from the "SEA/LEA IDP"
    And the role attribute equals <AnyDefaultSLIRole>
    And I am authenticated on "SEA/LEA IDP"

    When I navigate to GET "/school/<'Apple Elementary School' ID>"
    Then I should receive a link named "getSessions" with URI "/school-session-associations/<'Apple Elementary School' ID>/targets"

        
    When I navigate to  "getSessions" with URI "/school-session-associations/<'Apple Elementary School' ID>/targets"
    Then I should receive a collection of 2 session links
        And after resolution, I should receive a "Session" with ID <'Spring 2011' ID>
        And after resolution, I should receive a "Session" with ID  <'Fall 2011' ID>
    
    When I navigate to each session
    Then I should recieve a link named "getSections"     with URI "/session-section-associations/<'Spring 2011' ID>/targets"
    
    When I navigate to "getSections"     with URI "/session-section-associations/<'Spring 2011' ID>/targets"
        Then I should recieve a collection of 4 sections links
        And after resolution, I should recieve a "Section" with ID <'Section 1' ID>
        And after resolution, I should recieve a "Section" with ID <'Section 2' ID>
        
    When I navigate to each section    
    Then I search for assessments with URI "/section-assessment-associations/<'Each Section' ID>/targets?AssessmentFamilyHierarchyName="AP"&AssessmentTile="AP English"&AssessmentSubject="English"
         Then  I should receive 1 assessment link
            And after resolution, I should receive an "Assessment" with ID "<'AP English' ID>"
           
        
    When I navigate to GET "/assessments/<'AP English' ID>"
        Then the "AssessmentTitle" is "AP English"
             And the "AssessmentCategory" is "Advanced Placement"
             And the "AssessmentSubjectType" is "English"
             And the "GradeLevelAssessed" is "Twelfth Grade"

             And the "AssessmentPerformanceLevel" has the 5 levels
             And the "AssessmentPerformanceLevel" levels contain a "Code" value of "1"
             And the "AssessmentPerformanceLevel" levels contain a "Code" value of "2"
             And the "AssessmentPerformanceLevel" levels contain a "Code" value of "3"
             And the "AssessmentPerformanceLevel" levels contain a "Code" value of "4"
             And the "AssessmentPerformanceLevel" levels contain a "Code" value of "5"
             And I should recieve a link to "getStudentAssessmentAssociations" with URI "/student-assessment-associations/<'AP English' ID>"
      
      When I navigate to GET "/student-section-association/<'Each Section' ID>/targets"
        Then I should receive a collection of 5 student links
     
     Given I loop through the collection of student links   
         When I navigate to GET "/student-assessment-associations/<'AP English' ID>"
             And filter by <'Current_student' ID> 
             Then I get 1 student-assessment-association 
                     And the "AdministrationDate" is "2012/01/10"
                 And the "AdministrationEndDate" is "2012/01/15"
                 And the "ScaleScore.AssessmentReportingResultType" = "ScaleScore"
                 And the "ScaleScore.Result" is a random number between {1,5}
                 
Examples:
| Username        | Password            | AnyDefaultSLIRole  |
| "administrator" | "administrator1234" | "IT Administrator" |
| "leader"        | "leader1234"        | "Leader"           |
