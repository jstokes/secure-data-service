This is the data I am assuming for these tests
SectionName:  Algebra II
ClassPeriod = 3
Teacher = Ms. Jones

@wip
Scenario: As a teacher I want to see all my students in 3rd period Algebra II class and view ISAT Math 2011 assessment scores
Given format "application/json"
When I navigate to GET /teachers/<'Ms. Jones' ID>
Then I should see a link named "getTeacherSectionAssociations" with URI  /teacher-section-associations/<'Ms. Jones' ID>
	And I should see  a link named "getSections" with URI  /teacher-section-associations/<'Ms. Jones' ID>/targets
	And I should see a link named "self" with URI /teachers/<'Ms. Jones' ID>

When I navigate to "getSections" with URI  /teacher-section-associations/<'Ms. Jones' ID>/targets
Then I should receive a collection of 3 section links that resolve to
	And I should find section with sectionName is "French" and classPeriod is "5"
	And I should find section with sectionName is "Algebra II" and classPeriod is "3"  with <'ImportantSection' ID>
	And I should find section with sectionName is "Algebra II" and classPeriod is "1"

When I navigate to "getSections" with URI  /teacher-section-associations/<'Ms. Jones' ID>/targets and filter by sectionName is "Algebra II" and classPeriod is "3"
Then I should receive 1 section link that resolve to
	And I should see a link named "getStudents" with URI /student-section-associations/<'ImportantSection' ID>/targets

When I navigate to "getStudents" with URI /student-section-associations/<'ImportantSection' ID>/targets
Then I should receive a collection of 5 student links that resolve to
	And I should find Student with <'John Doe' ID>
	And I should find Student with <'Sean Deer' ID>
	And I should find Student with <'Suzy Queue' ID>
	And I should find Student with <'Mary Line' ID>
 	And I should find Student with <'Dong Steve' ID>

When I navigate to GET /students/<'Suzy Queue' ID>
Then I should see a link named "getStudentAssessmentAssociations" with URI "/student-assessment-associations/<'Suzy Queue' ID>
	And I should see a link named "getAssessments" with URI /student-assessment-associations/<'Suzy Queue' ID>/targets

When I navigate to "getAssessments" with URI /student-assessment-associations/<'Suzy Queue' ID>/targets and filter by "assessmentTitle" = "ISAT MATH"
    Then I should receive 1 assessment
    When I navigate to  "getStudentAssessmentAssociations" with URI /student-assessment-associations/<'ISAT MATH' ID>
	And filter by "administrationDate" is between "2011-01-01" and "2011-12-31"
     And filter by "studentID" is <'Suzy Queue' ID>
    Then I should find a ScoreResult is 89
	  And I should find a PerformanceLevel is 3
