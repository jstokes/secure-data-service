Feature: In order to manage students and assessments
As a SLI application I want to see analysis or scoring of a student's response on an assessment. 
I must be able to perform CRUD functions on student-assessment association.

This is the data I am assuming for these tests
AssessmentTitle: Mathematics Achievement Assessment Test, Writing Advanced Placement Test
AssessmentSubject: Mathematics, Writing, Foreign Language
GradeLevelAssessed: Adult
ContentStandard: School Standard
AssessmentCategory: Achievement  Test,  Advanced Placement Test
Student: Jane Doe

Background: Logged in as a super-user and using the small data set
	Given I am logged in using "demo" "demo1234"
	Given I have access to all students and assessments


Scenario: Create a student-assessment-association
Given format "application/vnd.slc+json"
	And Assessment ID is <'Mathematics Achievement  Assessment Test' ID>
	And Student ID is <'Jane Doe' ID>
	And AdministrationDate is "2011-12-01"
	And ScoreResults is "85"
	And PerformanceLevel is "3"
	When I navigate to POST "/student-assessment-associations"
Then I should receive a return code of 201
	And I should receive a ID for the newly created student-assessment-association


Scenario: Read a student-assessment-association
Given format "application/json"
When I navigate to GET /student-assessment-associations/<Student 'Jane Doe' and AssessmentTitle 'Writing Achievement Assessment Test' ID>
Then I should receive a return code of 200
	And I should receive 1 student-assessment-assoications
	And I should receive a link named "getStudent" with URI /students/<'Jane Doe' ID>
	And I should receive a link named "getAssessment" with URI /assessments/<'Writing Achievement Assessment Test' ID>
	And the "administrationDate" should be "2011-09-15"
	And the "administrationEndDate" should be "2011-12-15"
	And the "retestIndicator" should be "1"
	And the "scoreResults" should be "85"
	And the "performanceLevel" should be "3"
