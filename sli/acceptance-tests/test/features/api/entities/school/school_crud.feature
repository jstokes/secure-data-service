Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to manage schools
    As a client application using SLI
    I want to have create, read, update, and delete functionality for a school.

Background: Logged in as a super-user and using the small data set
	Given I am logged in using "demo" "demo1234"
	Given I have access to all schools

#### Happy Path 
Scenario: Create a new school JSON
    Given format "application/json"
       And the "shortNameOfInstitution" is "SCTS"
	  And the "nameOfInstitution" is "School Crud Test School"
	  And the "webSite" is "www.scts.edu"
    When I navigate to POST "/schools/" 
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
       And I should receive an ID for the newly created school
    When I navigate to GET "/schools/<'newly created school' ID>"
    Then I should see the "shortNameOfInstitution" is "SCTS"
      And I should see the "nameOfInstitution" is "School Crud Test School"
      And I should see the "webSite" is "www.scts.edu"

	  
Scenario: Read a school by id
    Given format "application/json"
    When I navigate to GET "/schools/<'Apple Alternative Elementary School' ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
       And I should see the "nameOfInstitution" is "Apple Alternative Elementary School"
       And I should see the "telephoneNumber" is "(785) 667-6006"
       And I should receive a link named "self" with URI "/schools/<'Apple Alternative Elementary School' ID>"
       And I should receive a link named "getTeacherSchoolAssociations" with URI "/teacher-school-associations/<'Apple Alternative Elementary School' ID>"
       And I should receive a link named "getTeachers" with URI "/teacher-school-associations/<'Apple Alternative Elementary School' ID>/targets"
       And I should receive a link named "getStudents" with URI "/student-school-associations/<'Apple Alternative Elementary School' ID>/targets"
       And I should receive a link named "getStudentSchoolAssociations" with URI "/student-school-associations/<'Apple Alternative Elementary School' ID>"

Scenario: Update an existing school
    Given format "application/json"
    When I navigate to GET "/schools/<'Yellow Middle School' ID>"
    Then I should see the "nameOfInstitution" is "Yellow Middle School"
    When I set the "nameOfInstitution" to "Yellow Middle and High School"
    When I navigate to PUT "/schools/<'Yellow Middle School' ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
    When I navigate to GET "/schools/<'Yellow Middle School' ID>"
 	Then I should see the "nameOfInstitution" is "Yellow Middle and High School"

 	 
Scenario: Delete an existing school
    Given format "application/json"
    When I navigate to DELETE "/schools/<'Delete Me Middle School' ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
     When I navigate to GET "/schools/<'Delete Me Middle School' ID>"
     Then I should receive a return code of 404
        

### Error handling
Scenario: Attempt to read a non-existing school
    Given format "application/json"
    When I navigate to GET "/schools/<'that doesn't exist' ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 404      

Scenario: Attempt to delete a non-existing school
    Given format "application/json"
    When I navigate to DELETE "/schools/<'that doesn't exist' ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 404      

Scenario: Update a non-existing school
    Given format "application/json"
    When I attempt to update "/schools/<'that doesn't exist' ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 404      
    
Scenario: Fail when asking for an unsupported format "text/plain"
    Given format "text/plain"
    When I navigate to GET "/schools/<'Apple Alternative Elementary School' ID>"
    Then I should receive a return code of 406
    
Scenario: Fail if going to the wrong URI
	Given format "application/json"
	When I navigate to GET "/school/<'using a wrong URI' ID>"
     Then I should receive a return code of 404
