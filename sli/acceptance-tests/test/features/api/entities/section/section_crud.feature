Feature: <US565> In order to manage sections
    As a client application using SLI
    I want to have create, read, update, and delete functionality for a section.

Background: Logged in as a super-user and using the small data set
  	Given the SLI_SMALL dataset is loaded
    Given I am logged in using "demo" "demo1234"
    Given I have access to all students

#### Happy Path 
Scenario Outline: Create a new section
    Given format <format>
      	And the UniqueSectionCode is "SpanishB09"
      	And the SequenceOfCourse is 1
       	And the EducationalEnvironment is "OFF_SCHOOL_CENTER"
       	And the MediumOfInstruction is "INDEPENDENT_STUDY"
       	And the PopulationServed is "REGULAR_STUDENTS"
	When I navigate to POST "/sections/" 
    Then I should receive a return code of 201
       	And I should receive a ID for the newly created section
    When I navigate to GET /sections/<'newly created section' ID>
    Then I should see the SequenceOfCourse is 1
      And I should see the EducationalEnvironment is "OFF_SCHOOL_CENTER"
      And I should see the MediumOfInstruction is "INDEPENDENT_STUDY"
      And I should see the PopulationServed is "REGULAR_STUDENTS"

Scenario Outline: Read a section by id
    Given format <format>
    When I navigate to GET /sections/<'biologyF09' ID>
    Then I should receive a return code of 200
    	And I should see the SequenceOfCourse is 1
     	And I should see the EducationalEnvironment is "OFF_SCHOOL_CENTER"
     	And I should see the MediumOfInstruction is "INDEPENDENT_STUDY"
     	And I should see the PopulationServed is "REGULAR_STUDENTS"

    And the SequenceOfCourse is 2
    When I navigate to PUT /sections/<'biologyF09' ID>
    Then I should receive a return code of 204
    When I navigate to GET /sections/<'biologyF09' ID>
     And I should see the SequenceOfCourse is 2
    Examples:
    		| format                     |
    		| "application/json"         |

      And I should receive a link named "getTeacherSectionAssociations" with URI /teacher-section-associations/<'biology567' ID>
