Feature: In order to manage assessments
As a SLI Application I want to be able to manage the basic model of assessments. This includes performing CRUD on Assessment entity.
Also verify the correct links from assessment to student-assessment associations and family-assessment associations. An assessment can 
be used to measure differences in individuals or groups and changes in performance from one occasion to the next.


This is the data I am assuming for these tests
assessmentTitle: Mathematics Achievement Assessment Test, Writing Advanced Placement Test
academicSubject: Mathematics, Writing, Foreign Language
gradeLevelAssessed: Adult
contentStandard: School Standard
assessmentCategory: Achievement  Test,  Advanced Placement Test

  	Given I am logged in using "demo" "demo1234"
