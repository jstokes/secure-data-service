Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to manage assessments
As a SLI Application I want to be able to manage the basic model of assessments. This includes performing CRUD on Assessment entity.
Also verify the correct links from assessment to student-assessment associations and family-assessment associations. An assessment can 
be used to measure differences in individuals or groups and changes in performance from one occasion to the next.
