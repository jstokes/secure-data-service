		And the link at index 1 should point to an entity with id "7a238370-415e-4fc0-9c5e-565cb8394d13"
		And the header "TotalCount" equals 3
		And the a next link exists with offset equal to 2 and limit equal to 2
		And the a previous link should not exist

Scenario: Paging request the first two results from an API request using /targets
    Given format "application/json"
		And parameter "sortBy" is "studentUniqueStateId"
		And parameter "sortOrder" is "ascending"
