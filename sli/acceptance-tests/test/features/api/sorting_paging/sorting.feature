		And parameter "sort-by" is "name.firstName"
		And parameter "sort-order" is "descending"
	When I navigate to GET "/student-school-associations/<'Krypton Middle School' ID>/targets"
	Then I should receive a collection
		And the link at index 0 should point to an entity with id "e0e99028-6360-4247-ae48-d3bb3ecb606a"

	Then I should receive a collection with 3 elements
 	Given parameter "start-index" is "0"
		And parameter "max-results" is "2"
	When I navigate to GET "/student-school-associations/<'Krypton Middle School' ID>"
	Then I should receive a collection with 2 elements
		And the link at index 0 should point to an entity with id "094b9681-4fbc-4d59-a05d-87f6f5d0b759"
		And the link at index 1 should point to an entity with id "7a238370-415e-4fc0-9c5e-565cb8394d13"
		And the header "TotalCount" equals 3
		And the a next link exists with start-index equal to 2 and max-results equal to 2
		And the a previous link should not exist
		
Scenario: Paging request the first two results from an API request using /targets
    Given format "application/json"
		And parameter "sort-by" is "name.firstName"
		And parameter "sort-order" is "ascending"
	When I navigate to GET "/student-school-associations/<'Krypton Middle School' ID>/targets"
	Then I should receive a collection with 2 elements
 	Given parameter "start-index" is "0"
		And parameter "max-results" is "1"
	When I navigate to GET "/student-school-associations/<'Krypton Middle School' ID>/targets"
	Then I should receive a collection with 1 elements
