Feature: <US63> In order to manage students and schools 
    As a client application using SLI
    I want to know what students are currently enrolled at a particular school, 
		and I want to know what schools a student currently attends.  I also want
		to be able to manage these relationships by enrolling and un-enrolling students.
		This means we should be able to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE student enrollment associations.
