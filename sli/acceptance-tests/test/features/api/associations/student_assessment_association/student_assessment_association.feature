Feature: In order to manage students and assessments
As a SLI application I want to see analysis or scoring of a student's response on an assessment. 
I must be able to perform CRUD functions on student-assessment association.

This is the data I am assuming for these tests
AssessmentTitle: Mathematics Achievement Assessment Test, Writing Advanced Placement Test
AssessmentSubject: Mathematics, Writing, Foreign Language
GradeLevelAssessed: Adult
ContentStandard: School Standard

Given format "application/json"
	And "assessmentID" is <'Mathematics Achievement  Assessment Test' ID>
	And "studentID" is <'Jane Doe' ID>
	And "administrationDate" is "2011-12-01"
	And "scoreResults" is "85"
	And "performanceLevel" is "3"
When I navigate to POST "/student-assessment-associations"
