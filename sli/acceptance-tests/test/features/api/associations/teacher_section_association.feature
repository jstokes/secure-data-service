Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to manage teacher-section associations
  This means I want to be able to perform CRUD on teacher-section-associations
  Also verify the correct links from that resource to the appropriate teacher and section.

This is the data I am assuming for these tests:
Teacher: Ms Jones, Mr. Smith
Section: Chem I, Physics II, Biology III, Algebra II


Background: Nothing yet

Scenario: Create a teacher-section-association
Given format "application/json"
  And Teacher is <Ms. Jones' ID>
  And Section is <Algebra II>
  And the beginDate is "8/15/2011"
  And the endDate is "12/15/2011"
  And the classroomPosition is "teacher of record"
When I navigate to POST "/teacher-section-associations"
Then I should receive a return code of 201
  And I should receive a ID for the newly created teacher-section-association
When I navigate to GET /teacher-section-associations/<'newly created teacher-section-association' ID>
Then the endDate should be "8/15/2011"
    And the beginDate should be "12/15/2011"
    And the classroomPosition should be "teacher of record"

Scenario: Read a teacher-section-association
Given format "application/json"
When I navigate to Teacher Section Associations for Teacher "Ms. Jones" and Section "Algebra II"
Then I should receive a return code of 200
  And I should receive 1 teacher-section-associations
  And I should receive a link named “getTeacher” with URI /teachers/<'Ms. Jones' ID>
  And I should receive a link named “getSection” with URI /sections/<'Algebra II' ID>
  And I should receive a link named "self" with URI /teacher-section-association/<'self' ID>
  And the beginDate should be "9/1/2011"
  And the endDate should be "12/16/2011"
  And highlyQualifiedTeacher should be true
  And classroomPosition should be teacher of record

Scenario: Reading a teacher-section-association for a teacher
Given format "application/json"
When I navigate to GET teacher-section-associations/<'Ms. Jones' ID>
Then I should receive a return code of 200
  And classroom position is teacher of record
  And I should receive a collection of 4 teacher-section-association links that resolve to
  And I should receive a link named “getTeacher” with URI /teachers/<'Ms. Jones’ ID>
  And I should receive a link named “getSection” with URI /sections/<'Chem I' ID>
  And I should receive a link named “getSection” with URI /sections/<'Physics II' ID>
  And I should receive a link named “getSection” with URI /sections/<'Biology III' ID>

Scenario: Reading a teacher-section-association for a section
Given format "application/json"
When I navigate to Teacher Section Association for the Section “Chem I”
Then I should receive a return code of 200
And classroom position is teacher of record
  And I should receive a collection of 3 teacher-section-association links that resolve to
  And I should receive a link named “getSection” with URI /sections/<'Chem I' ID>
  And I should receive a link named “getTeacher” with URI /teachers/<'Ms. Jones' ID>
  And I should receive a link named “getTeacher” with URI /teachers/<'Mr. Smiths' ID>

Scenario: Update a teacher-section-association
Given format "application/json"
  And  I navigate to teacher-section-associations for Teacher "Ms. Jones" and Section "Algebra II"
  And classroomPosition is "teacher of record"
When  I set the classroomPosition to "assistant teacher"
  And I navigate to PUT /teacher-section-associations/<'the previous association' Id>
Then I should receive a return code of 200
  And I navigate to GET /teacher-section-associations/<'the previous association' Id>
  And the classroomPosition should be "assistant teacher"


Scenario: Delete a teacher-section-association
Given format "application/json"
When  I navigate to DELETE /teacher-section-associations/<'the previous association' Id>
Then I should receive a return code of 200
  And I navigate to GET /teacher-section-associations/<'the previous association' Id>
  And I should receive a return code of 404
