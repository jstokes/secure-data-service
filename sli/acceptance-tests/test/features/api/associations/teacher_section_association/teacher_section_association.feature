Feature: As an SLI application, I want to be able to manage teacher-section associations
  This means I want to be able to perform CRUD on teacher-section-associations
  Also verify the correct links from that resource to the appropriate teacher and section.

This is the data I am assuming for these tests:
Teacher: Ms Jones, Mr. Smith
Section: Chem I, Physics II, Biology III, Algebra II


Background: Nothing yet

Scenario: Create a teacher-section-association
Given format "application/json"
  And "teacherID" is <'Ms. Jones' ID>
  And "sectionID" is <'Algebra II' ID>
  And the "beginDate" is "2011-8-15"
  And the "endDate" is "2011-12-15"
  And the "classroomPosition" is "TEACHER_OF_RECORD"
When I navigate to POST "/teacher-section-associations"
Then I should receive a return code of 201
  And I should receive a ID for the newly created teacher-section-association
When I navigate to GET /teacher-section-associations/<'newly created teacher-section-association' ID>
Then the "endDate" should be "2011-8-15"
    And the "beginDate" should be "2011-12-15"
    And the "classroomPosition" should be "TEACHER_OF_RECORD"

Scenario: Read a teacher-section-association
Given format "application/json"
When I navigate to GET /teacher-section-associations/<'Teacher "Ms. Smith" and Section "Algebra II"' ID>
Then I should receive a return code of 200
  And I should receive 1 teacher-section-association
  And I should receive a link named “getTeacher” with URI /teachers/<'Ms. Smith' ID>
  And I should receive a link named “getSection” with URI /sections/<'Algebra II' ID>
  And I should receive a link named "self" with URI /teacher-section-association/<'self' ID>
  And the "beginDate" should be "2011-9-1"
  And the "endDate" should be "2011-12-16"
  And "highlyQualifiedTeacher" should be true
  And "classroomPosition" should be teacher of record

Scenario: Reading a teacher-section-association for a teacher
Given format "application/json"
When I navigate to GET /teacher-section-associations/<'Ms. Nancy' ID>
Then I should receive a return code of 200
  And classroom position is teacher of record
  And I should receive a collection of 4 teacher-section-association links that resolve to
  And I should receive a link named “getTeacher” with URI /teachers/<'Ms. Nancy’ ID>
  And I should receive a link named “getSection” with URI /sections/<'Chem I' ID>
  And I should receive a link named “getSection” with URI /sections/<'Physics II' ID>
  And I should receive a link named “getSection” with URI /sections/<'Biology III' ID>

Scenario: Reading a teacher-section-association for a section
Given format "application/json"
When I navigate to GET /teacher-section-associations/<'Chem I' ID>
Then I should receive a return code of 200
And "classroomPosition" is "TEACHER_OF_RECORD"
  And I should receive a collection of 3 teacher-section-association links that resolve to
  And I should receive a link named “getSection” with URI /sections/<'Chem I' ID>
  And I should receive a link named “getTeacher” with URI /teachers/<'Ms. Nancy' ID>
  And I should receive a link named “getTeacher” with URI /teachers/<'Mr. Thomas' ID>

Scenario: Update a teacher-section-association
Given format "application/json"
  And  I navigate to GET /teacher-section-associations/<'Teacher "Ms. Jenny" and Section "Algebra II"' ID>
  And "classroomPosition" is "TEACHER_OF_RECORD"
When  I set the "classroomPosition" to "ASSISTANT_TEACHER"
  And I navigate to PUT /teacher-section-associations/<'the previous association' ID>
Then I should receive a return code of 200
  And I navigate to GET /teacher-section-associations/<'the previous association' ID>
  And the "classroomPosition" should be "ASSISTANT_TEACHER"


Scenario: Delete a teacher-section-association
Given format "application/json"
When  I navigate to DELETE /teacher-section-associations/<'a currently valid and independent association'' ID>
Then I should receive a return code of 200
  And I navigate to GET /teacher-section-associations/<'a currently valid and independent association' ID>
  And I should receive a return code of 404
