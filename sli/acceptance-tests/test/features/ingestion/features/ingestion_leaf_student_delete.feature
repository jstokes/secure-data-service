Feature: Safe Deletion and Cascading Deletion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: delete student with cascade
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
  And I post "prep_cascading_deletion.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName                            |
     | student                                   |
     | studentParentAssociation                  |

     | disciplineIncident                        |
     | disciplineAction                          |
     | studentDisciplineIncidentAssociation      |
     | studentCompetency                         |
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "prep_cascading_deletion.zip" is completed in database
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName                            |              count|
