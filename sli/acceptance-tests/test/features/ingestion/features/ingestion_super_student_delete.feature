Feature: Ingestion SuperDoc Deletion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Ingestion of Student-Orphans(Entities referring to missing student) conforms to Student and Children ingestion followed by Student deletion
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty

    #Ingest data set with the lone student commented out. aka out of order data set. Then take snapshot.
    Given I post "SuperStudent_NoStudent.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "SuperStudent_NoStudent.zip" is completed in database
    And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
    And I should not see a warning log file created
    And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
    Then there exist "1" "student" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "studentHCount"
