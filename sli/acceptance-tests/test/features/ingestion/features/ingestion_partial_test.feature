Feature: Partial Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Partial ingestion of data
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "PartialIgestionDataSet_Tier0.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
