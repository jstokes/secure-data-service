Feature: Demo Data Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

Scenario: Post a zip file containing all configured interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I post "DemoData.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |
        | studentSchoolAssociation    |
        | course                      |
        | educationOrganization       |
        | school                      |
        | section                     |
        | studentSectionAssociation   |
        | teacher                     |
        | teacherSchoolAssociation    |
        | teacherSectionAssociation   |
        | session                     |
        | assessment                  |
        | studentAssessmentAssociation|
        | studentTranscriptAssociation|
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
#    And "30" seconds have elapsed
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
        | collectionName              | count |
        | student                     | 72    |
        | studentSchoolAssociation    | 107   |
        | course                      | 14    |
        | educationOrganization       | 3     |
        | school                      | 5     |
        | section                     | 23    |
        | studentSectionAssociation   | 143   |
        | teacher                     | 4     |
        | teacherSchoolAssociation    | 6     |
        | teacherSectionAssociation   | 20    |
        | session                     | 6     |
        | assessment                  | 15    |
        | studentAssessmentAssociation| 100   |
        | studentTranscriptAssociation| 40    |
    And I check to find if record is in collection:
       | collectionName              | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter          | searchValue                | searchType           |

Scenario: Post a zip file containing all configured interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job: Populated Database
Given I post "DemoData.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
