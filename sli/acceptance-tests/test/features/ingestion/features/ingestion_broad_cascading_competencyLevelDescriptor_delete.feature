Feature: Safe Deletion and Cascading Deletion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

@wip
Scenario: Delete Competency Level Descriptor with cascade
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
    And I should see child entities of entityType "competencyLevelDescriptor" with id "d82250f49dbe4facb59af2f88fe746f70948405d_id" in the "Midgar" database	
    And I post "BroadCompetencyLevelDescriptorDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "BroadCompetencyLevelDescriptorDelete.zip" is completed in database
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created
	And I should not see "d82250f49dbe4facb59af2f88fe746f70948405d_id" in the "Midgar" database
	And I should not see any entity mandatorily referring to "d82250f49dbe4facb59af2f88fe746f70948405d_id" in the "Midgar" database
	And I should see entities optionally referring to "d82250f49dbe4facb59af2f88fe746f70948405d_id" be updated in the "Midgar" database
	
	
Scenario: Delete Competency Level Descriptor with cascade = false and force = true, log violations = true
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
    Then there exist "1" "competencyLevelDescriptor" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "competencyLevelDescriptor"
	|field      |value                                           |

    And I save the collection counts in "Midgar" tenant   
    And I post "ForceCompetencyLevelDescriptorDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone

	And I should see "records considered for processing: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records ingested successfully: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records deleted successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records failed processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records not considered for processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I re-execute saved query "competencyLevelDescriptor" to get "0" records
	And I see that collections counts have changed as follows in tenant "Midgar"
	 |collection                        |delta     |
	 |competencyLevelDescriptor         |        -1|
	 |recordHash                        |        -1|
