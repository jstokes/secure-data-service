Feature: Safe Deletion and Cascading Deletion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
    Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Multiple Orphans
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
    And I save the collection counts in "Midgar" tenant
    And I post "MultipleForceDeletes.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "MultipleForceDeletes.zip" is completed in database
    And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeAssessmentMetadata.xml"
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeStudentGrades.xml"
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeMasterSchedule.xml"
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeEducationOrganization.xml"
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeStudentCohort.xml"
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeStudentParent.xml"
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeStaffAssociation.xml"
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeStudentAssessment.xml"
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeStudentEnrollment.xml"
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeStudentDiscipline.xml"
	And I should not see an error log file created
    And I see that collections counts have changed as follows in tenant "Midgar"
