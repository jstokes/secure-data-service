Feature: Sandbox Medium Fidelity Data Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Post a zip file containing the sandbox small fidelity data as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "IL-Daybreak"
    And I post "SmallSampleDataSet.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |
        | studentSchoolAssociation    |
        | course                      |
        | educationOrganization       |

        | gradingPeriod               |
        | calendarDate                |
        | reportCard                  |
        | studentAcademicRecord       |
  When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created

Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
        | collectionName              | count |

Scenario: Post a zip file containing the sandbox medium fidelity data as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "IL-Daybreak"
    And I post "MediumSampleDataSet.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
   And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |
        | studentSchoolAssociation    |
        | course                      |

        | reportCard                  |
        | studentAcademicRecord       |
  When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created

Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
        | collectionName              | count |
