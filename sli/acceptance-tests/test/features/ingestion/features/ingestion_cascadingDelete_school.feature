Feature: Safe Deletion and Cascading Deletion 

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: delete "Jets School", AssignmentSchoolReference is wiped out in the DisciplineAction, ResponsibilitySchoolReference still points to "Sharks School"; delete "Sharks School", DisciplineAction is deleted.
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
  And I post "prep_cascading_deletion_school.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "prep_cascading_deletion_school.zip" is completed in database
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName                            |              count|
     | student                                   |					1|
     | staff                                     |                  1|
     | educationOrganization                     |					5|
     | disciplineAction                          |					1|
     | disciplineIncident                        |					1|
    And I check to find if record is in collection:
       | collectionName                        | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter                  | searchValue                                  | searchType   |
