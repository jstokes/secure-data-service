Feature: Safe Deletion and Cascading Deletion 

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
@wip
Scenario: Test insert dataset 
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
  And I post "prep_cascading_deletion.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:

When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "prep_cascading_deletion.zip" is completed in database
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:

    And I should see "Processed 49 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created

Scenario: delete "Jets School", AssignmentSchoolReference is wiped out in the DisciplineAction, ResponsibilitySchoolReference still points to "Sharks School"; delete "Sharks School", DisciplineAction is deleted.
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
  And I post "prep_cascading_deletion_school.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
