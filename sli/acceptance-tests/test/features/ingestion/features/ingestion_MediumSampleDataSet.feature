Feature: Sample Data Set Ingestion Timimg

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

Scenario: Post Medium Sample Data Set
Given I post "MediumSampleDataSet.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName                            |
     | assessment                                |

When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "MediumSampleDataSet.zip" is completed in database
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName                              | count |
     | assessment                                  | 1 |

	And I should see "Processed 38494 records." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created
