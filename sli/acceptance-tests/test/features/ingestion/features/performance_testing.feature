Feature: Ingestion Performance Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using destination-local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

@smoke
@integration
Scenario: Post a zip file containing all configured interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job
Given I want to ingest locally provided data "PerformanceData.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
When local zip file is moved to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:

        | attendance                  | 13650     |
    And I should see "Processed 15073 records." in the resulting batch job file
