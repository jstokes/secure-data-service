Scenario: Post StudentAssessment without required parent records in database

Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
  And I post "StudentAssessment_Partial_Unhappy.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName                            |
     | studentAssessment              |
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "StudentAssessment_Partial_Unhappy.zip" is completed in database
  Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName                           |              count|
     | studentAssessment             |                  0|
    And I should see "Not all records were processed completely due to errors." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "Processed 3 records." in the resulting batch job file

Scenario: Post StudentAssessment records with required parent records previously ingested

Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
