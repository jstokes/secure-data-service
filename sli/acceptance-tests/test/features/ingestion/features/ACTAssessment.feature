Feature: ACT Assessment Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
  And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

Scenario: Post a zip file containing all configured interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I post "actAssessmentMetadata.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName              |
     | assessment                  |
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName              | count |
     | assessment                  | 1     |
   And I check to find if record is in collection:
     | collectionName              | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter                                                     | searchValue                                      |

  And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
  And I should not see an error log file created
  And I should see "InterchangeAssessmentMetadata-ACT.xml records considered: 1" in the resulting batch job file
  And I should see "InterchangeAssessmentMetadata-ACT.xml records ingested successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
  And I should see "InterchangeAssessmentMetadata-ACT.xml records failed: 0" in the resulting batch job file
  
  

Scenario: Post a zip file containing all student assessment interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I post "actStudentAssessment.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName                         |
     | student                                |
     | assessment                             |
     | studentAssessmentAssociation           |
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
