Feature: Safe Deletion and Cascading Deletion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

@wip
Scenario: Delete Teacher  with cascade
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
	And I should see child entities of entityType "teacher" with id "fe472294f0e40fd428b1a67b9765360004562bab_id" in the "Midgar" database

    And I post "BroadTeacherDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "BroadTeacherDelete.zip" is completed in database
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created
	And I should not see "fe472294f0e40fd428b1a67b9765360004562bab_id" in the "Midgar" database
    And I should not see any entity mandatorily referring to "fe472294f0e40fd428b1a67b9765360004562bab_id" in the "Midgar" database
	And I should see entities optionally referring to "fe472294f0e40fd428b1a67b9765360004562bab_id" be updated in the "Midgar" database
