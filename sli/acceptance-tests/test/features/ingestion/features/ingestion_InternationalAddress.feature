Feature: Sample Data Set Ingestion Timimg

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Post Small Sample Data Set
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
  And I post "AddressLine.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName                            |

  When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "AddressLine.zip" is completed in database
  Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName                           |              count|
     | educationOrganization                    |                  3|
     | parent                                   |                  1|
     | recordHash                               |                 14|
     | staff                                    |                  3|
     | student                                  |                  1|
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created
    And I check to find if record is in collection:
       | collectionName              | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter            | searchValue                | searchType           |
