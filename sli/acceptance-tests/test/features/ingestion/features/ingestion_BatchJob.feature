Feature: Batchjob Datamodel Data Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

Scenario: Post a minimal zip file as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I post "BatchJob.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in batch job datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | newBatchJob                 |
        | error                       |
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | securityEvent               |

When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "BatchJob.zip" is completed in database

Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding batch job db collections:
        | collectionName              | count |
        | newBatchJob                 | 1     |

 And I check to find if record is in batch job collection:
  | collectionName | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter                  | searchValue                          | searchType |

Scenario: Post two zip files to different landing zones then see the batch jobs in the database: Clean Database
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "IL-Daybreak"
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "NY-NYC"
    And I post "BatchJobLarge.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job for "IL-Daybreak"
    And I post "BatchJob.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job for "NY-NYC"

    And the following collections are empty in batch job datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | newBatchJob                 |
        | error                       |
        | tenantJobLock               |

When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone for "IL-Daybreak"
  And zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone for "NY-NYC"
  And a batch job for file "BatchJob.zip" is completed in database
  And a batch job for file "BatchJobLarge.zip" is completed in database

Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding batch job db collections:
        | collectionName              | count |
        | newBatchJob                 | 2     |

 And I check to find if record is in batch job collection:
  | collectionName | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter                | searchValue             | searchType |
  | newBatchJob    | 1                   | totalFiles                     | 1                       | integer    |

Scenario: Post two zip files to the same landing zone and see that the second is locked out: Clean Database
Given I post "BatchJobLarge.zip" and "BatchJob.zip" files as the payload of two ingestion jobs
    And the following collections are empty in batch job datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | newBatchJob                 |
        | error                       |
        | tenantJobLock               |

When zip files are scped to the ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "BatchJob.zip" is completed in database
  And a batch job for file "BatchJobLarge.zip" is completed in database

Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding batch job db collections:
        | collectionName              | count |
        | newBatchJob                 | 2     |

 And I check to find if record is in batch job collection:
  | collectionName | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter                | searchValue             | searchType |
  | newBatchJob    | 1                   | totalFiles                     | 1                       | integer    |
  | newBatchJob    | 1                   | status                         | CompletedSuccessfully   | string     |
  | newBatchJob    | 1                   | status                         | CompletedWithErrors     | string     | 
  | newBatchJob    | 1                   | resourceEntries.0.resourceId   | BatchJob.zip            | string     |
  | newBatchJob    | 1                   | resourceEntries.0.resourceId   | BatchJobLarge.zip       | string     |

 And I should see "ERROR  Another job is currently running for this tenant.  Please retry this ingestion once it has finished." in the resulting error log file
