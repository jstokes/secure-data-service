Feature: Batchjob Datamodel Data Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

Scenario: Post a minimal zip file as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I post "BatchJob.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in batch job datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | newBatchJob                 |

When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created

Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding batch job db collections:
        | collectionName              | count |
        | newBatchJob                 | 1     |

 And I check to find if record is in batch job collection:
  | collectionName | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter                  | searchValue                          | searchType |
