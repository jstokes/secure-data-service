Feature: Acceptance Storied Data Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
  And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "IL-Daybreak"
  And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "NY-NYC"

Scenario: Post zip files containing all data for Illinois Daybreak and NY NYC as the payload for parallel ingestion jobs: Clean Database
Given the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName                        |
        | student                               |

        | staffCohortAssociation                |
        | studentCohortAssociation              |
        | learningStandard                      |
        | disciplineIncident                    |
  And I post "Parallel_IL_Daybreak.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job for "IL-Daybreak"
  And I post "Parallel_NY.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job for "NY-NYC"
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone for "IL-Daybreak"
  And zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone for "NY-NYC"
  And a batch job log has been created for "IL-Daybreak"
  And a batch job log has been created for "NY-NYC"
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
