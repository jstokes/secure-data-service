Feature: Ingestion of Class Periods and Bell Schedules

Scenario: Ingestion of Bell Schedules and Class Periods

#initial ingestion
Given the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
Then I ingest "BellSchedulesAndClassPeriods.zip"
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName                           |            count |
     | bellSchedule                             |                1 |
     | calendarDate                             |                1 |
     | classPeriod                              |                1 |
     | educationOrganization                    |                1 |
     | section                                  |                1 |
     | recordHash                               |                5 |

Then there exist "1" "bellSchedule" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "bellSchedule"
    |field       													  |value                                               |

Then there exist "1" "classPeriod" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "classPeriod"

#duplicate ingestion
When I post "BellSchedulesAndClassPeriods.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
And zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone with name "BellSchedulesAndClassPeriods2.zip"
Then a batch job for file "BellSchedulesAndClassPeriods2.zip" is completed in database
And I should not see an error log file created
And I should not see a warning log file created
And I should see "InterchangeEducationOrganization.xml classPeriod 1 deltas!" in the resulting batch job file
And I should see "InterchangeEducationOrganization.xml educationOrganization 1 deltas!" in the resulting batch job file
And I should see "InterchangeEducationOrgCalendar.xml calendarDate 1 deltas!" in the resulting batch job file
And I should see "InterchangeMasterSchedule.xml bellSchedule 1 deltas!" in the resulting batch job file
And I should see "InterchangeMasterSchedule.xml section 1 deltas!" in the resulting batch job file
And I re-execute saved query "bellSchedule" to get "1" records
And I re-execute saved query "classPeriod" to get "1" records
And I re-execute saved query "section" to get "1" records

#updates through ingestion
Then I ingest "BellScheduleUpdates.zip"
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
