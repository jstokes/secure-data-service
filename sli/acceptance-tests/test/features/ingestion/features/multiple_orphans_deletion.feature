Feature: Safe Deletion and Cascading Deletion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
    Given I am using local data store

@wip
Scenario: Multiple Orphans
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
    And I save the collection counts in "Midgar" tenant
    And I post "MultipleOrphansDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "MultipleOrphansDelete.zip" is completed in database
	And I should see "Not all records were processed completely due to errors." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "Processed 21 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "InterchangeEducationOrganization.xml records failed processing: 2" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting error log file
    And I should see "CORE_0071" in the resulting error log file
	And I should not see a warning log file created
    And I see that collections counts have changed as follows in tenant "Midgar"
        | collection                            |    delta|
        |assessment                             |       -1|

        |recordHash                             |      -17|

    #grade lives in yearly transcript so -1 for each expected
    #3 assessment types not record hashed
