Feature: Safe Deletion and Cascading Deletion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Delete Objective Assessment From Assessment Metadata with cascade
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
	And I should see child of entityType "objectiveAssessment" with id "58346902a070426a109f451129eeeb1268daed21_idd705e26a138eb9e608e23b4c82fd6257633b7244_id" in the "Midgar" database	
    And I post "BroadObjectiveAssessmentFromAssessmentMetadataDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	Then there exist "1" "assessment" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "objectiveAssessment"
	|field                                                           |value                                                                                          |
	|objectiveAssessment._id                                         |58346902a070426a109f451129eeeb1268daed21_idd705e26a138eb9e608e23b4c82fd6257633b7244_id         |
#	Then there exist "1" "assessment" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "subobjectiveAssessment"
#	|field                                                           |value                                                                                          |
#	|objectiveAssessment.body.subObjectiveAssessment                 |2001-First grade Assessment 1.OA-0                                                             |
#	Then there exist "1" "studentAssessment" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "studentAssessment"
#	|field                                                           |value                                                                                          |
#	|studentObjectiveAssessment.body.objectiveAssessmentId           |58346902a070426a109f451129eeeb1268daed21_idd705e26a138eb9e608e23b4c82fd6257633b7244_id         |
	And I save the collection counts in "Midgar" tenant
  	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "BroadObjectiveAssessmentFromAssessmentMetadataDelete.zip" is completed in database
	And I should see "records considered for processing: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records ingested successfully: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records deleted successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records failed processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records not considered for processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created
	And I re-execute saved query "objectiveAssessment" to get "0" records
#	And I re-execute saved query "subobjectiveAssessment" to get "0" records
#	And I re-execute saved query "studentAssessment" to get "0" records
	And I see that collections counts have changed as follows in tenant "Midgar"
	|collection                        |delta          |
	|objectiveAssessment                    |        -1|
	|recordHash                             |         0|
	And I should not see "58346902a070426a109f451129eeeb1268daed21_idd705e26a138eb9e608e23b4c82fd6257633b7244_id" in the "Midgar" database
    And I should not see any entity mandatorily referring to "58346902a070426a109f451129eeeb1268daed21_idd705e26a138eb9e608e23b4c82fd6257633b7244_id" in the "Midgar" database
	And I should see entities optionally referring to "58346902a070426a109f451129eeeb1268daed21_idd705e26a138eb9e608e23b4c82fd6257633b7244_id" be updated in the "Midgar" database
