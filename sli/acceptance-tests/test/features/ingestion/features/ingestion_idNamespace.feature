Feature: idNamespace Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
  And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

Scenario: Post a zip file containing all configured interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I post "idNamespace.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName              |
     | session                     |
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName              | count |
     | session                     | 1     |
   And I check to find if record is in collection:
     | collectionName              | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter             | searchValue             | searchType           |
     | session                     | 1                   | metaData.idNamespace        | https://dummysite.com   | string               |
  And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
  And I should not see an error log file created
  And I should see "idNamespace.xml records considered: 1" in the resulting batch job file
  And I should see "idNamespace.xml records ingested successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
  And I should see "idNamespace.xml records failed: 0" in the resulting batch job file

Scenario: Post a zip file containing all configured interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I post "idNamespaceDefault.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName              |
     | session                     |
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created

     | collectionName              | count |
     | session                     | 1     |
   And I check to find if record is in collection:
     | collectionName              | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter             | searchValue                          | searchType           |
     | session                     | 1                   | metaData.idNamespace        | SLI    | string               |
  And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
  And I should not see an error log file created
  And I should see "idNamespace.xml records considered: 1" in the resulting batch job file
  And I should see "idNamespace.xml records ingested successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
  And I should see "idNamespace.xml records failed: 0" in the resulting batch job file
