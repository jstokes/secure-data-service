Feature: Odin Data Set Ingestion Correctness and Fidelity

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using odin data store

Scenario: Post Odin Sample Data Set
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
  And the tenant database for "Midgar" does not exist
  And I post "OdinSampleDataSet.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:

     | assessment                                |

When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName                           |              count|

    And I should see "Processed 766 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created
