Feature: Assessment Super doc delete 

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store


Scenario: Ingestion of Assessment-Orphans(Entities referring to missing Assessment) conforms to Assessment and Children ingestion followed by Assessment deletion
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    
    #Ingest data set with the lone Assessment comment out. aka out of order data set. Then take snapshot.
    And I post "SuperAssessmentSubdocAndDenormOnly.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "SuperAssessmentSubdocAndDenormOnly.zip" is completed in database
    Then there exist "1" "assessment" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "AssessmentHCount"
    |field       													  |value                                               |
    |_id         													  |458b6701422b88c1e3d01dd217bc7e76f77621a4_id         |
    |assessmentItem.body.assessmentId                          		  |458b6701422b88c1e3d01dd217bc7e76f77621a4_id         |
    |objectiveAssessment.body.assessmentId                            |458b6701422b88c1e3d01dd217bc7e76f77621a4_id         |
    Then there exist "0" "assessment" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "AssessmentNHCount"
    |field       													  |value                                               |
    |_id         													  |458b6701422b88c1e3d01dd217bc7e76f77621a4_id         |
    |body.gradeLevelAssessed										  |Third grade                                         |
    |body.assessmentFamilyReference  								  |1b37e1eb4516a453fece7f01b5af7a3fb86741a8_id         |
    |body.assessmentPeriodDescriptorId								  |8ee096782782740ca1b846b0ad4c269f032e8aa5_id         |
    |body.assessmentIdentificationCode.ID							  |2002-Third grade Assessment 1                       |
    |body.assessmentIdentificationCode.identificationSystem           |State                                               |
    |body.assessmentTitle                                             |2002-Third grade Assessment 1                       |
    And I read the following entity in "Midgar" tenant and save it as "hollowAssessment"
    | collection | field | value								      |
    | Assessment    | _id   |458b6701422b88c1e3d01dd217bc7e76f77621a4_id |
    
    #Clear out the database
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    And I re-execute saved query "AssessmentHCount" to get "0" records
    
    #Ingest same data set again. This time with the lone Assessment not commented out.
    And I post "SuperAssessmentAll.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "SuperAssessmentAll.zip" is completed in database
    And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
    And I re-execute saved query "AssessmentHCount" to get "1" records
    And I re-execute saved query "AssessmentNHCount" to get "1" records

    #Delete Assessment   
    And I post "SuperAssessmentOnlyDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "SuperAssessmentOnlyDelete.zip" is completed in database
    And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
    And I re-execute saved query "AssessmentHCount" to get "1" records
    And I re-execute saved query "AssessmentNHCount" to get "0" records
    
    #Take new snapshot and compare with old snapshot
    #And I read again the entity tagged "hollowAssessment" from the "Midgar" tenant and confirm that it is the same
    
    #Reingest Assessment
    Given I post "SuperAssessmentOnly.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "SuperAssessmentOnly.zip" is completed in database
    And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
    And I re-execute saved query "AssessmentHCount" to get "1" records
    And I re-execute saved query "AssessmentNHCount" to get "1" records
