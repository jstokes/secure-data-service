Scenario: Preload Small Sample Data Set
  Given I am using the tenant "Brian"
  And the tenant database "Brian" does not exist
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:

Scenario: Preload Medium Sample Data Set
   Given I am using the tenant "Sharon"
   And the tenant database "Sharon" does not exist
   Then I create a tenant set to preload data set "medium" for tenant "Sharon"
   And a batch job has completed successfully in the database
   And a batch job log has been created
