Feature: Pre-loading of data for sandbox tenants - Ingestion component test

Scenario: Preload Sample Data Sets
  When I am using the tenant "Sharon"
  And the tenant database "Sharon" does not exist
  Then I create a tenant set to preload data set "medium" for tenant "Sharon"
  When I am using the tenant "Brian"
  And the tenant database "Brian" does not exist
  And I create a tenant set to preload data set "small" for tenant "Brian"
  When I am using the tenant "Sharon"
  And the tenant database "Sharon" does not exist
  Then I create a tenant set to preload data set "medium" for tenant "Sharon"
  And a batch job has completed successfully in the database for tenant "Sharon"
  And I should not see an error log file created for "Sharon"
  And I should not see a warning log file created for "Sharon"
  When I am using the tenant "Brian"
  And a batch job has completed successfully in the database for tenant "Brian"
  Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
