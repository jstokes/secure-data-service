    And I save the collection counts in "Midgar" tenant
    And I post "BroadSessionDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "BroadSessionDelete.zip" is completed in database
    And a batch job log has been created
	And I should see "records considered for processing: 1" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "records ingested successfully: 0" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "records deleted successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "records failed processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "records not considered for processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created
    And I re-execute saved query "session" to get "0" records
