Feature: Ingestion delete tests for StudentObjectiveAssessment

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Safe delete of StudentObjectiveAssessment with Cascade = false, Force = false and LogViolations = false
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
    Then there exist "1" "studentAssessment" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "studentObjectiveAssessment"
        |field                                     |value                                                                                 |
        |studentObjectiveAssessment._id            |02c2c55fa1ecd2f47091d3f4df61bd6b525e6524_ide82adaec5b649ec175fad108f36ca030f69437c7_id|
    And I save the collection counts in "Midgar" tenant
    And I post "SafeStudentObjectiveAssessmentDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "SafeStudentObjectiveAssessmentDelete.zip" is completed in database
    And a batch job log has been created
    And I should see "records deleted successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "child records deleted successfully: 0" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "records failed processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "records not considered for processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
   	And I should not see a warning log file created
    And I re-execute saved query "studentObjectiveAssessment" to get "0" records
    And I see that collections counts have changed as follows in tenant "Midgar"
        | collection                                |     delta|
        | studentObjectiveAssessment                |        -1|
        # uncomment the following line once studentObjectiveAssessment is supported by the recordHash
        # | recordHash                                |      	 -1|

Scenario: Safe delete of StudentObjectiveAssessment by ref with Cascade = false, Force = false
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"

    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
