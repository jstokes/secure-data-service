Feature: Safe Deletion and Cascading Deletion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Delete StudentAssessment with cascade
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty

  #    And I post "BroadSetOfTypes.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  #    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  #    Then a batch job for file "BroadSetOfTypes.zip" is completed in database
  #    And I should not see an error log file created
  #    And I should not see a warning log file created

  When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
