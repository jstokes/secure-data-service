Feature: Sample Data Set Ingestion Timimg

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
@wip
Scenario: Test insert dataset 
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
  And I post "prep_cascading_deletion.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:

When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "prep_cascading_deletion.zip" is completed in database
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
