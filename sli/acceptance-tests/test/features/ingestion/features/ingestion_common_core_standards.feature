Feature: Common Core Standard Ingestion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
  And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone


Scenario: Post a zip file containing all configured Learning Objective interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I post "CommonCoreStandards/grade12English.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName              |
     | learningObjective           |
     | learningStandard            |
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName              | count |
     | learningObjective           | 1     |
     | learningStandard            | 10    |
   And I check to find if record is in collection:
     | collectionName              | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter                              | searchValue           		|
     | learningObjective           | 1                   | body.objective					            | Reading: Informational Text  	|
     | learningObjective           | 1                   | body.objectiveGradeLevel                   	| Twelfth grade                 |
     | learningStandard            | 10                  | body.gradeLevel                              | Twelfth grade               |
     | learningStandard            | 10                  | body.subjectArea                             | ELA    |
     | learningStandard            | 10                  | body.contentStandard                         | State Standard    |

  And I should see "Processed 11 records." in the resulting batch job file
  And I should not see an error log file created
  And I should see "Grade_12_English_CCS_RI_11_12.xml records considered: 1" in the resulting batch job file
  And I should see "Grade_12_English_CCS_RI_11_12.xml records ingested successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
  And I should see "Grade_12_English_CCS_RI_11_12.xml records failed: 0" in the resulting batch job file

Given I post "CommonCoreStandards/grade12Math.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:

Scenario: Verify resolved references and ingestion to populated database
Given I post "CommonCoreStandards/grade12Math.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
