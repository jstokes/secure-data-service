Feature: Common Core Standard Ingestion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
  And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone


Scenario: Post a zip file containing all configured Learning Objective interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
  Given I post "CommonCoreStandards/grade12English.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName              |
     | learningObjective           |
     | learningStandard            |
     | recordHash                  |
  When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "grade12English.zip" is completed in database
  Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName              | count |
     | learningObjective           | 70    |
     | learningStandard            | 954   |
   And I check to find if record is in collection:
     | collectionName              | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter                              | searchValue                   |
     | learningObjective           | 3                   | body.objective                               | Reading Science/Technical     |
     | learningObjective           | 8                   | body.objectiveGradeLevel                     | Eleventh grade                |
     | learningStandard            | 113                 | body.gradeLevel                              | Eleventh grade                |
     | learningStandard            | 954                 | body.subjectArea                             | English                       |
     | learningStandard            | 954                 | body.contentStandard                         | State Standard                |

  And I should see "Processed 1024 records." in the resulting batch job file
  And I should not see an error log file created
  And I should see "InterchangeAssessmentMetadata-CCS-English.xml records considered for processing: 1024" in the resulting batch job file
  And I should see "InterchangeAssessmentMetadata-CCS-English.xml records ingested successfully: 1024" in the resulting batch job file
  And I should see "InterchangeAssessmentMetadata-CCS-English.xml records failed processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file


Scenario: Post a zip file containing all configured High School Math CCS interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I post "CommonCoreStandards/grade12Math.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName                     |
     | learningObjective                  |
     | learningStandard                   |
     | recordHash                         |
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "grade12Math.zip" is completed in database
  Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName              | count |
     | learningObjective           | 65     |
     | learningStandard            | 509    |
   And I check to find if record is in collection:
     | collectionName              | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter                                | searchValue    |

  And I should see "Processed 574 records." in the resulting batch job file
  And I should not see an error log file created

Scenario: Verify resolved references and ingestion to populated database
Given I post "CommonCoreStandards/grade12Math.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName                     |
     | learningObjective                  |
     | learningStandard                   |
     | recordHash                         |
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName              | count |
     | learningObjective           | 65     |
     | learningStandard            | 509    |
Given I post "CommonCoreStandards/grade12Math.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone with name "grade12Math2.zip"
  And a batch job for file "grade12Math2.zip" is completed in database
  Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName              | count |
     | learningObjective           | 65     |
     | learningStandard            | 509    |
When I find a record in "learningObjective" where "body.objective" is "Circles"
Then the field "body.learningStandards" is an array of size 5
