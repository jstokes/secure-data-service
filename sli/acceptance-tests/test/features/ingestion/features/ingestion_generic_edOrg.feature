    When I ingest "GenericEdOrgUpdates.zip"
    Then "16" records in the "educationOrganization" collection with field "body.nameOfInstitution" matching ".*Updated" should be in the "Midgar" tenant db

    #duplicate detection test
    And I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
      | collectionName                           |              count|
      | recordHash                               |                 16|
      | educationOrganization                    |                 16|
    # clear out the ingested entities to ensure we aren't upserting a second time
    Given the following collections are empty in datastore:
      | collectionName                            |
      | educationOrganization                     |
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone with name "Reingest-GenericEdOrg.zip"
    Then a batch job for file "Reingest-GenericEdOrg.zip" is completed in database
    And I should see "InterchangeEducationOrganization.xml educationOrganization 16 deltas" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see a warning log file created
    And I should not see an error log file created
    And I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
      | collectionName                           |              count|
      | recordHash                               |                 16|
      | educationOrganization                    |                  0|
