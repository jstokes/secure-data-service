Feature: Acceptance Storied Data Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

@smoke @integration @IL-Daybreak
Scenario: Post a zip file containing all data for Illinois Daybreak as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName                        |

        | teacherSchoolAssociation              |

  And the following collections are empty in sli datastore:

        | securityEvent                         |
  When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak.zip" is completed in database

Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:

@integration @IL-Sunset
Scenario: Post a zip file containing all data for Illinois Sunset as a payload of the ingestion job: Append Database
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Sunset"
   And I post "StoriedDataSet_IL_Sunset.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "StoriedDataSet_IL_Sunset.zip" is completed in database
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:

    When I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak_Deltas.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak_Deltas.zip" is completed in database
    And I should not see a warning log file created
    And I should not see an error log file created
    Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
        | collectionName              | count |
        | gradebookEntry              | 13    |
        | studentGradebookEntry       | 316   |
        | studentCompetency           | 60    |
        | grade                       | 5     |

        | staffCohortAssociation      | 4     |
        | staffProgramAssociation     | 11    |
    And I check to find if record is in collection:
        | collectionName              | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter                | searchValue             | searchType           |
