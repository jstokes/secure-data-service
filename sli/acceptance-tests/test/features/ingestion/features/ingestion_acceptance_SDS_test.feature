Feature: Acceptance Storied Data Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

@smoke @integration @IL-Daybreak
Scenario: Post a zip file containing all data for Illinois Daybreak as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName                        |
        | assessment                            |

  When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created

Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:

@integration @IL-Sunset
Scenario: Post a zip file containing all data for Illinois Sunset as a payload of the ingestion job: Append Database
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Sunset"
   And I post "StoriedDataSet_IL_Sunset.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
   And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:

@integration @NY-NYC
Scenario: Post a zip file containing all data for New York as a payload of the ingestion job: Append Database
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Hyrule-NYC"
  And I post "StoriedDataSet_NY.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:

Scenario: Post an append zip file containing append data for Illinois Daybreak as a payload of the ingestion job: Append Database
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
  And I post "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak_Append.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:

    When I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak_Deltas.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job log has been created
    Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
