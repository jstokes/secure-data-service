Feature: Acceptance Storied Data Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

@smoke @integration @IL-Daybreak
Scenario: Post a zip file containing all data for Illinois Daybreak as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "IL-Daybreak"
    And I post "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |

        | reportCard                  |
        | studentAcademicRecord       |
  When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created

Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
        | collectionName              | count |

Scenario: Post a zip file containing all data for Illinois Sunset as a payload of the ingestion job: Append Database
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "IL-Sunset"

When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
