Feature: Acceptance Canonical Data Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

@smoke
@integration
Scenario: Post a zip file containing all configured interchanges as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I post "AcceptanceCanonicalData.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |
        | studentSchoolAssociation    |
        | course                      |
        | educationOrganization       |
        | school                      |
        | section                     |
        | studentSectionAssociation   |
        | teacher                     |
        | staff                       |
        | teacherSchoolAssociation    |
        | teacherSectionAssociation   |
        | session                     |
        | assessment                  |
        | studentAssessmentAssociation|
        | gradebookEntry              |
        | studentTranscriptAssociation|
        | studentSectionGradebookEntry|
        | parent                      |
        | studentParentAssociation    |
        | attendance                  |
When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job log has been created
Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
        | collectionName              | count |
        | student                     | 78    |
        | studentSchoolAssociation    | 165   |
        | course                      | 9     |
        | educationOrganization       | 3     |
        | school                      | 4     |
        | section                     | 9     |
        | studentSectionAssociation   | 209   |
        | teacher                     | 3     |
        | staff                       | 2     |
        | teacherSchoolAssociation    | 4     |
        | teacherSectionAssociation   | 4     |
        | session                     | 10    |
        | assessment                  | 4     |
        | studentAssessmentAssociation| 116   |
        | studentTranscriptAssociation| 50    |
        | parent                      | 9     |
        | studentParentAssociation    | 9     |
        | gradebookEntry              | 12    |
        | studentSectionGradebookEntry| 78   |
        | attendance                  | 13650 |
    And I check to find if record is in collection:
       | collectionName              | expectedRecordCount | searchParameter          | searchValue                | searchType           |

       | student                     | 1                   | metaData.externalId      | 800000012                  | string               |
       | student                     | 1                   | metaData.externalId      | 900000024                  | string               |
       | teacher                     | 1                   | metaData.externalId      | cgray                      | string               |
       | course                      | 1                   | metaData.externalId      | 1st Grade Homeroom         | string               |
       | school                      | 1                   | metaData.externalId      | South Daybreak Elementary  | string               |
       | educationOrganization       | 1                   | metaData.externalId      | IL-DAYBREAK                | string               |
       | educationOrganization       | 1                   | metaData.externalId      | IL                         | string               |
