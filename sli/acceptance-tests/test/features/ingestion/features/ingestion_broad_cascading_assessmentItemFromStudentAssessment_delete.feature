	Then there exist "1" "assessment" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "objectiveAssessmentRefs"
	|field                                                           |value                                                                                          |
	|objectiveAssessment.body.assessmentItemRefs                     |58346902a070426a109f451129eeeb1268daed21_id406e5f1c9ff1339aaf93fc8f3fe21ff6fead0439_id          |
	Then there exist "2" "studentAssessment" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "studentAssessment"
	|field                                                           |value                                                                                          |
	|studentAssessmentItem.body.assessmentItemId                     |58346902a070426a109f451129eeeb1268daed21_id406e5f1c9ff1339aaf93fc8f3fe21ff6fead0439_id          |
	And I save the collection counts in "Midgar" tenant
    And I post "ForceAssessmentItemRefFromStudentAssessmentDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "ForceAssessmentItemRefFromStudentAssessmentDelete.zip" is completed in database
        And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "records deleted successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "records failed processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeStudentAssessment.xml"
    And I re-execute saved query "assessmentItem" to get "0" records
	And I see that collections counts have changed as follows in tenant "Midgar"
	|collection                        |delta          |
	|assessmentItem                         |        -1|
	#|recordHash                             |        -1|
