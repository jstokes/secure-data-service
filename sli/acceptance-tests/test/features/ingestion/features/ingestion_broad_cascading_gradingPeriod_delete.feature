Scenario: Delete Grading Period with cascade
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
	Then there exist "1" "gradingPeriod" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "gradingPeriod"
	|field                                                           |value                                                |

	Then there exist "1" "session" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "session"

	And I save the collection counts in "Midgar" tenant
    And I post "BroadGradingPeriodDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "BroadGradingPeriodDelete.zip" is completed in database
	And I should see "records considered for processing: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records ingested successfully: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records deleted successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records failed processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records not considered for processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created
    And I re-execute saved query "gradingPeriod" to get "0" records
    And I re-execute saved query "session" to get "0" records
    #And I re-execute saved query "reportCard" to get "0" records
    #And I re-execute saved query "gradebookEntry" to get "0" records
    And I see that collections counts have changed as follows in tenant "Midgar"

        |gradingPeriod|   -1|
        |session      |   -1|
