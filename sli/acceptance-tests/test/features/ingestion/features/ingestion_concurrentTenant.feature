Feature: Concurrent tenant ingestion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Concurrent job processing
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Hyrule-NYC"
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | assessment                  |
        | attendance                  |
        | calendarDate                |
        | cohort                      |
        | course                      |
        | courseOffering              |
        | disciplineAction            |
        | disciplineIncident          |
        | educationOrganization       |
        | grade                       |
        | gradebookEntry              |
        | gradingPeriod               |
        | learningObjective           |
        | learningStandard            |
        | parent                      |
        | program                     |
        | reportCard                  |
        | section                     |
        | session                     |
        | staff                       |
        | staffCohortAssociation      |
        | staffProgramAssociation     |
        | student                     |
        | studentAcademicRecord       |
        | studentAssessment           |
        | studentCohortAssociation    |
        | studentCompetency           |
        | studentCompetencyObjective  |
        | studentDisciplineIncidentAssociation|
        | studentGradebookEntry       |
        | studentParentAssociation    |
        | studentProgramAssociation   |
        | studentSchoolAssociation    |
        | studentSectionAssociation   |
        | courseTranscript            |
        | teacherSchoolAssociation    |
        | teacherSectionAssociation   |
        |staffEducationOrganizationAssociation|
    And I post "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak.zip" and "StoriedDataSet_NY.zip" files as the payload of two ingestion jobs
When zip files are scped to the ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "StoriedDataSet_IL_Daybreak.zip" is completed in database
  And a batch job for file "StoriedDataSet_NY.zip" is completed in database
  Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
        | collectionName              | count |
        | assessment                  | 19    |

        | teacherSectionAssociation   | 27    |
   Then I should not see an error log file created
