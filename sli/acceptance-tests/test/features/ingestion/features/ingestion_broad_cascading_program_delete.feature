Scenario: Delete Program with cascade
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
	Then there exist "1" "educationOrganization" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "localEducationAgency"
	|field                                                           |value                                                |

	|field                                                           |value                                                |

	Then there exist "104" "staffProgramAssociation" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "staffProgramAssociation"
	|field                                                           |value                                                |

	Then there exist "9" "student" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "student"
	|field                                                           |value                                                |

	And I save the collection counts in "Midgar" tenant   
    And I post "BroadProgramDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "BroadProgramDelete.zip" is completed in database
	And I should see "records considered for processing: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records ingested successfully: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records deleted successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records failed processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records not considered for processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created

	And I re-execute saved query "studentProgramAssociation" to get "0" records
	And I re-execute saved query "staffProgramAssociation" to get "0" records
	And I re-execute saved query "student" to get "0" records
	And I see that collections counts have changed as follows in tenant "Midgar"

	|studentProgramAssociation              |       -14|
	And I should not see "0064dd5bb3bffd47e93b023585e6591c018ee697_id" in the "Midgar" database
    And I should not see any entity mandatorily referring to "0064dd5bb3bffd47e93b023585e6591c018ee697_id" in the "Midgar" database
	And I should see entities optionally referring to "0064dd5bb3bffd47e93b023585e6591c018ee697_id" be updated in the "Midgar" database

    And I see that collections counts have changed as follows in tenant "Midgar"
        | collection                                |     delta|
        | program                                   |        -1|

Scenario: Delete Program with cascade = false and force = true, log violations = true
	Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported			
	  Then there exist "1" "program" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "program"
        |field      |value                                               |

    And I save the collection counts in "Midgar" tenant
    And I post "ForceProgramDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "ForceProgramDelete.zip" is completed in database
	  And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should see "records deleted successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	  And I should see "records failed processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
	  And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeEducationOrganization.xml"
    And I re-execute saved query "program" to get "0" records
    And I see that collections counts have changed as follows in tenant "Midgar"
