Feature: Dashboard Sad Path Ingestion Test

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

 @IL-Daybreak
Scenario: Post a zip file containing all data for Illinois Daybreak as a payload of the ingestion job: Clean Database
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "DashboardSadPath_IL_Daybreak.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:

When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
  And a batch job for file "DashboardSadPath_IL_Daybreak.zip" is completed in database
  And a batch job log has been created
  And I should see "Processed 186 records." in the resulting batch job file
