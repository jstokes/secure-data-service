Feature: Odin Data Set Ingestion Correctness and Fidelity
Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using odin data store 

Scenario: Post Odin Sample Data Set
Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
  And I post "OdinSampleDataSet.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  And the following collections are empty in datastore:
     | collectionName                            |
     | assessment                                |

When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
And a batch job for file "OdinSampleDataSet.zip" is completed in database

Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
     | collectionName                           |              count|
     | student                                  |                264|
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created

Scenario: Verify specific staff document for Rebecca Braverman ingested correctly: Populated Database
  When I can find a "staff" with "body.teacherUniqueStateId" "rbraverman" in tenant db "Midgar"
    Then the "staff" entity "type" should be "teacher"

Scenario: Verify specific staff document for Charles Gray ingested correctly: Populated Database
  When I can find a "staff" with "body.teacherUniqueStateId" "cgray" in tenant db "Midgar"
    Then the "staff" entity "type" should be "teacher"

Scenario: Verify specific staff document for Linda Kim ingested correctly: Populated Database
  When I can find a "staff" with "body.teacherUniqueStateId" "linda.kim" in tenant db "Midgar"
    Then the "staff" entity "type" should be "teacher"
    
Scenario: Verify superdoc studentSchoolAssociation references ingested correctly: Populated Database
  When Examining the studentSchoolAssociation collection references
    Then the document references "educationOrganization" "_id" with "body.schoolId"
    And the document references "student" "_id" with "body.studentId"
    And the document references "student" "schools._id" with "body.schoolId"
    And the document references "student" "schools.entryDate" with "body.entryDate"
    #And the document references "student" "schools.entryGradeLevel" with "body.entryGradeLevel"

Scenario: Verify staffEducationOrganizationAssociation references ingested correctly: Populated Database
  When Examining the staffEducationOrganizationAssociation collection references
    Then the document references "educationOrganization" "_id" with "body.educationOrganizationReference"
     And the document references "staff" "_id" with "body.staffReference"

Scenario: Verify teacherSchoolAssociation references ingested correctly: Populated Database
  When Examining the teacherSchoolAssociation collection references
    Then the document references "educationOrganization" "_id" with "body.schoolId"
     And the document references "staff" "_id" with "body.teacherId"

Scenario: Verify the sli verification script confirms everything ingested correctly
    Given the edfi manifest that was generated in the 'generated' directory
    And the tenant is 'Midgar'
    Then the sli-verify script completes successfully
