Feature: Negative Ingestion Testing

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
    Given I am using local data store
	And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

Scenario: Post an empty zip file should fail
	Given I post "emptyFile.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |   
	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
	And "10" seconds have elapsed
	And I should see "Processed 0 records." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "File student.xml: Empty file" in the resulting batch job file
	
@wip
Scenario: Post a zip file where the first record has an incorrect enum for an attribute value
	Given I post "valueTypeNotMatchAttributeType.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |   
	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
	And "5" seconds have elapsed
	And I should see "Record 1: Enumeration mismatch for field <sex> (provided: [Boy], expected: [[Female, Male]])" in the resulting error log file
	And I should see "Not all records were processed completely due to errors." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
	
@wip
Scenario: Post a zip file where the first record has a bad attribute should fail on that record and proceed
	Given I post "firstRecordHasIncorrectAttribute.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |   
	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
	And "5" seconds have elapsed
	And I should see "Fatal problem saving records to database." in the resulting error log file
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "Not all records were processed completely due to errors." in the resulting batch job file
	
@wip
Scenario: Post a zip file where the second record has a bad attribute should fail and process previous records
	Given I post "secondRecordHasIncorrectAttribute.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job

	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "Not all records were processed completely due to errors." in the resulting batch job file
	
@wip
Scenario: Post a zip file where the first record has an undefined attribute should fail on that record and proceed
	Given I post "firstRecordHasMoreAttributes.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |   
	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
	And "5" seconds have elapsed
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "Record 1: Unknown Field <FullName>" in the resulting error log file
	And I should see "Not all records were processed completely due to errors." in the resulting batch job file

	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "Not all records were processed completely due to errors." in the resulting batch job file
	

Scenario: Post a zip file where the the edfi input is malformed XML
	Given I post "malformedXML.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |   
	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
	And "5" seconds have elapsed
#	And I should see "Input file was malformed" in the resulting error log file
	And I should see "Processed 0 records." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "Not all records were processed completely due to errors." in the resulting batch job file
	
#not sure if this is a valid failure or not
