Feature: Odin Data Set Ingestion Correctness and Fidelity
  Background: I have a landing zone route configured
    Given I am using odin data store

  Scenario: Post Odin Sample Data Set
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the tenant database for "Midgar" does not exist
    And I post "Odin10k1SampleDataSet.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
      | collectionName                            |
      | assessment                                |

    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job log has been created
    Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:

    And I should see "Processed 202109 records." in the resulting batch job file
#    And I should not see an error log file created
#    And I should not see a warning log file created
