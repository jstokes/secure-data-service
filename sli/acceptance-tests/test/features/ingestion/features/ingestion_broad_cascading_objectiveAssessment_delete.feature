    And I post "ForceObjectiveAssessmentRefFromAssessmentMetadataDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	And I save the collection counts in "Midgar" tenant
  	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "ForceObjectiveAssessmentRefFromAssessmentMetadataDelete.zip" is completed in database
	And I should see "records considered for processing: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records ingested successfully: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records deleted successfully: 1" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records failed processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "records not considered for processing: 0" in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "All records processed successfully." in the resulting batch job file
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
    And I should see "CORE_0066" in the resulting warning log file for "InterchangeAssessmentMetadata.xml"
	And I re-execute saved query "objectiveAssessment" to get "0" records
	And I re-execute saved query "subobjectiveAssessment" to get "0" records
	And I re-execute saved query "studentAssessment" to get "2" records
	And I see that collections counts have changed as follows in tenant "Midgar"
	|collection                        |delta          |
	|objectiveAssessment                    |        -1|
