Scenario: Delete AssessmentFamily with cascade
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
   Then there exist "1" "assessmentFamily" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "assessmentFamily"
