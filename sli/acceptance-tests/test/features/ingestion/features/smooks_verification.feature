Feature: Smooks Verification

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store
    And I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone

Scenario: Assessment and StudentAssessment Verification
    Given I post "smooksVer_Assess_Student_Assess.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
        | collectionName              |
        | student                     |
        | assessment                  |
        | assessmentFamily            |
        | studentAssessment           |
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "smooksVer_Assess_Student_Assess.zip" is completed in database
        Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
        | collectionName              | count |
        | student                     | 1     |
        | assessment                  | 1     |
        | assessmentFamily            | 3     |
        | studentAssessment           | 1     |
    And I find a(n) "assessment" record where "body.assessmentTitle" is equal to "Grade 8 2011 StateTest Writing"
    And verify the following data in that document:
       | searchParameter                                                          | searchValue                           | searchType           |
