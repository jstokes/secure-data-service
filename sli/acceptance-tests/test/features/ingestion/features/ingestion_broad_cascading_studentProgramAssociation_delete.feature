Feature: Safe Deletion and Cascading Deletion

Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Delete Student Program Association with cascade
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
	And I should see child entities of entityType "studentProgramAssociation" with id "50dc8b12ef9184d88d8c304e635cf5a80d38bf79_id8f495c4527ad19c78a501a5646a2402d57cb6795_id" in the "Midgar" database
    And I post "BroadStudentProgramAssociationDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "BroadStudentProgramAssociationDelete.zip" is completed in database
    And a batch job log has been created
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created
	And I should not see "50dc8b12ef9184d88d8c304e635cf5a80d38bf79_idef393993fb4814a0d0b75ec2598cff3481df43f7_id" in the "Midgar" database
