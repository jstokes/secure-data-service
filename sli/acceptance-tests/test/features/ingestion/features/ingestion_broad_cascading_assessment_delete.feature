Scenario: Delete Assessment with cascade
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
	Then there exist "1" "assessment" records like below in "Midgar" tenant. And I save this query as "assessment"
	|field                               |value                                                                                          |

	And I save the collection counts in "Midgar" tenant
    And I post "BroadAssessmentDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
  	When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "BroadAssessmentDelete.zip" is completed in database
