Background: I have a landing zone route configured
Given I am using local data store

Scenario: Delete Student Competency with cascade
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And the "Midgar" tenant db is empty
    When the data from "test/features/ingestion/test_data/delete_fixture_data/" is imported
	And I should see child entities of entityType "studentCompetency" with id "315511d70c3e5e231aae544dd1c9b2dd980e8d8b_id" in the "Midgar" database
    And I post "BroadStudentCompetencyDelete.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "BroadStudentCompetencyDelete.zip" is completed in database
	And I should see "Processed 1 records." in the resulting batch job file
    And I should not see an error log file created
	And I should not see a warning log file created
	And I should not see "315511d70c3e5e231aae544dd1c9b2dd980e8d8b_id" in the "Midgar" database
    And I should not see any entity mandatorily referring to "315511d70c3e5e231aae544dd1c9b2dd980e8d8b_id" in the "Midgar" database
	And I should see entities optionally referring to "315511d70c3e5e231aae544dd1c9b2dd980e8d8b_id" be updated in the "Midgar" database
