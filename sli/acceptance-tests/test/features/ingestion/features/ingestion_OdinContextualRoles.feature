Feature: Odin Data Set Ingestion Correctness and Fidelity
  Background: I have a landing zone route configured
    Given I am using odin data store

  Scenario: Post Odin Sample Data Set
    Given I am using preconfigured Ingestion Landing Zone for "Midgar-Daybreak"
    And I post "OdinSampleDataSet.zip" file as the payload of the ingestion job
    And the following collections are empty in datastore:
      | collectionName                            |
      | assessment                                |

    When zip file is scp to ingestion landing zone
    And a batch job for file "OdinSampleDataSet.zip" is completed in database

    Then I should see following map of entry counts in the corresponding collections:
      | collectionName                           |              count|
      | student                                  |                274|
    And I should not see an error log file created
    And I should not see a warning log file created
