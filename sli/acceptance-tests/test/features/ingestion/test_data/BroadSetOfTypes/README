This data set was generated by Odin with the scenario "scenarios/broad"

The purpose of this data set is to try to generate a small set of
data, but with very broad coverage of entity types, so as to provide
coverage for model-driven functionality (e.g. cascading deletes)
by hitting as many parts of the model as possible.
