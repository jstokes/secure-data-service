This folder contains data files representing SLI meta data.

The purpose of these files is to support a Model-Driven approach to developing software artifacts and documentation.

Caution! Because UML is a notation without formal semantics there can be ambiguities and relative semantics. The approach
taken here is firstly to place the SLI UML model at the center of communication, and secondly to use the model to generate
software artifacts. Of course, the more that is done of the latter, the less likely the model and implementation are to diverge
and the more useful will be the model in its communication role.

The approach taken should be to have loose coupling between the logical model and implementation configuration. Configuration
files should be adjuncts (external) to the SLI logical model. This will avoid biasing the logical model to a particular implementation. 


Ed-Fi-Core.xsd
==============
This file is the W3C XML Schema file used to reverse engineer Ed-Fi into a UML format (the file produced is Ed-Fi-Core.xmi).
The tool used is Xsd2Xmi in the xsd2xmi project.

Ed-Fi-Core.xmi
==============
This file was generated by reverse engineering the Ed-Fi-Core.xsd schema. It was subsequently imported into ArgoUML.

SLI.uml
=======
This file is the ArgoUML project file (uncompressed) that represents the SLI Unified Model and ArgoUML diagrams.
It was obtained by saving the ArgoUML project created by importing Ed-Fi-Core.xmi, followed by manual tweaks to
replace reference attributes with associations.

SLI.xmi
=======
This file is obtained by exporting the SLI Unified Model in ArgoUML as XMI. It is the essence of the SLI Unified Model
with diagrams removed. This is the starting point for tooling. Note that the SLI.uml file contains the same embedded
XML Metadata Interchange file and so could be used directly (after the XMI parser has been generalized).
