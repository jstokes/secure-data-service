TODO:

	email validation doesn't seem right => email@test.co.uk , jeff.stokes@test.com
	explicit comparisons to false (if @user_account_registration.valid? ==false)
	methods _too_ long (ruby convention 6-12 lines per method)
	too much logic on controllers => delegate to models
	URLs need to be modified (/user_account_registration)
	do we need to serve json?     format.json  { render :json => @user_account_registration,
	                                   action: "/eulas?gUid="+@gUID}
   	UNIT TESTS!
