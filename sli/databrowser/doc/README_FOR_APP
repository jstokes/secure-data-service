Welcome to the SLC Databrowser!

In a nutshell, this application is used to traverse the SLC Api to see all of the data available to you.
You can explore the data by clicking on the links that the Api shows, or you can even explicitly tell
the Databrowser what part of the Api to visit.

*Configuration And Setup*
The SLC Databrowser is a fairly simple Ruby on Rails application, but there are a few customizations and
configuration files to be aware of.

Once you've prepped the Databrowser by installing the pre-requisite gems using bundler, you should take
a look in the config/config.yml file. This file contains the most important areas to configure. You will
find configuration on a per-environment basis.

First and foremost, are the url to the Api, callback, client_id, and client_secret. The first is the url
needed to actually access the SLC Api. Second, is the callback. You will want to replace everything before
"/callback" with the url to where you have the SLC Databrowser running. Finally the client_id and
client_secret are the two pieces of information you need to complete OAuth with this app. You can get these
values by going through the application registration process with the SLC. Once you have completed these
steps you can fill in the appropriate values.

*Running the App*
There are two ways you can run the application. First, is the common "rails server". Second, is to use thin.
To run thin you can also specify a configuration file which is located in /config/thin.yml. To make use
of it you can do something like: "bundle exec thin -C config/thin.yml start"

*Testing*
There are unit tests packaged in the test directory which can be started with the standard, "bundle exec rake".
We also use cucumber to do behavior tests.

TODO: Cucumber notes.

*Localization*
We make use of the localization in the config/locales directory to translate some of the fields that the Api
Would return. Simple things like 'firstName' would be translated to 'First Name', and so on.
