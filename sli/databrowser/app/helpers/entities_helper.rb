# This module contains a lot of the recursive view logic needed to display
# items correctly in the databrowser views.
#
# The basic process is that the data gets split into the simple view and
# a complex view which represent the full entity and the tabular list of
# entities.
#
# To build and display them we go through a number of different methods to
# pull out the configured table columns based on the entity type and move
# the data into those columns
#
# Some of the columns are are also based on what we have configured in
# config/views.yml
#
module EntitiesHelper

  # Here we go through the entities the API has returned and figure out what
  # type it is and then get the table columns out of set up.

  # Because entities are complex json objects this method will look at the
  # "path" we have described to extract the data to show in the table, and then
  # dig into that data to pull out the individual items
  #
  # At this point it doesn't support Arrays in complex types, it will just take
  # the first item in that array. Some example of where this will happen are in
  # addresses and names.
