/**
 * Generic entity returned by the SLI API ReSTful service. Each entity has a unique
 * identifier, a data collection, and a collection of resource links. This interface provides
 * the most stripped down interface required by all entities.
 *
 * Each entity returned by the SLI API contains a type string. This type identifies
 * the SLI data model type returned by the SLI. When creating or updating an entity, the
 * entity type must be provided. The SLI will reject entities that are not typed.
 *
 * Data is represented as a map of maps. Value types are defined by the SLI data model.
 * The API validates all incoming entities and rejects entities that are missing required
 * fields or contain invalid values.
 *
 * Each Entity returned by the API contains one or more links to associated resources.
 *
 * The fields returned by the API and the available resource links are context-dependent based
 * on the role(s) assigned by an identity provider. Responses contain only the information
 * available to the user based on these roles.
