Your request for developer sandbox account has been approved. There are some additional steps needed before you can use your sandbox environment.

First, you will need to select the sample school data to use in your sandbox (you can also supply your own sample data if you want.) by following this link:
<%= landingZoneLink %>

Second, after you have selected a data source, register your sandbox applications here:
<%= portalLink %>


Thank you,
SLC Operator
