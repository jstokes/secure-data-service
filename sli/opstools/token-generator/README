## Long Lived Token Generator for SLI ##

# Purpose #
This is a simple command-line tool to generate a long lived session token based on
a number of parameters. It is meant for testing and Sandbox use only!

# Installation #
Make sure you have :
* Ruby 1.9.2 (or higher)
* Bundler

From the token-generator directory run bundle install to install the other required
packages.

Then you can simply run the script by doing `ruby generator.rb`

# Options/Help #
The script has many defaults pre-configured already, you can search the script for
"options" to see what is already set.

If it isn't set to something you like you can change that value or pass it on using
one of the many command line options available.

Currently the defaults can be described like this:

* Connects to mongo on localhost:27017
* Sets the token expiration to 1 day
* Tries to use the realm named "The Sandbox Realm"

Everything else is required in order for this to work.

# Notes #
Parameters that are several words (Like the user's name) should be quoted.

Example usage:
ruby generator.rb -t developer@gmail.com -u "Charles Gray" -a "SLC Dashboards" -R "Sandbox Realm"

Example output: Your new long-lived session token is t-12345678-abcd-1234-5678-1234567890ab
