This script is used to trigger the ingestion of a file.
It is meant to be executed by ProFTPD using the mod_exec module hooked on the completion of the 'STOR' commmand (file upload finished).
The 'stomp' rubygem is required to issue the trigger command via ActiveMQ stomp protocol.
Configuration of this script is necessary based on the deployment environment (see below, "Configure based on deployment")

example invocations:
ruby publish_file_uploaded.rb STOR /home/ingestion/tenant/file.zip
ruby publish_file_uploaded.rb STOR /home/ingestion/tenant/file.zip local.slidev.org

=end

require "rubygems"
require "stomp"

#   Configure based on deployment
########################################
ACTIVEMQ_PORT = 61613
ACTIVEMQ_QUEUE = "ingestion.landingZone"
########################################
DEFAULT_ACTIVEMQ_HOST = "localhost"

operation = ARGV[0]
if operation == "STOR"

  path = ARGV[1]

  active_mq_host = DEFAULT_ACTIVEMQ_HOST
  unless ARGV[2].nil?
  	# use specified host, if provided
  	active_mq_host = ARGV[2]
  end

  client = Stomp::Client.new "", "", active_mq_host, ACTIVEMQ_PORT, false

  client.publish ACTIVEMQ_QUEUE, "File upload completed.", { :persistent => true, :filePath => path }

  puts "Sent message to queue #{ACTIVEMQ_QUEUE} on #{active_mq_host}: file has been uploaded: #{path}"
  client.close
end
