 * This is a {@link ApplicationListener} that gives us the opportunity to

 * 
 * The biggest thing this helps with are some ThreadLocals belonging to the main
 * web container thread that otherwise would never be cleaned up.
 * 
 * For example, anything that does a mongo query during app startup causes a
 * TenantContext to be created with ThreadLocals on the main thread.
