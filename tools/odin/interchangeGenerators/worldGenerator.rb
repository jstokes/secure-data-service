# World Generator
# -> intent is to create 'scaffolding' that represents a detailed, time-sensitive view of the world
#
# generation strategies:
# (1) create world using number of students + time information (begin year, number of years)
# (2) create world using number of schools  + time information (begin year, number of years) [not supported]
