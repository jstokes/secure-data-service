Ed-Fi file location for CSV2XML generation.

Not included in this distribution is the core Ed-Fi.xsd and the associated
Interchange*.xml files.  The latest versions of these files are located at the
Ed-Fi technical documentation website (http://www.ed-fi.org/technical-documentation/)

These files should be placed in the edfiXsd folder , prior to using
the CSV2XML converter.  The key files are:

 1. The core Ed-Fi.xsd file.  Click the 'Interim Ed-Fi Core XML Schema for SLC Alpha'
      link on the website.  Be sure to rename this file as 'Ed-Fi-Core.xsd'.  This
      file is version 1.0.03 and is the only version of the Ed-Fi schema currently
      supported.
      
 2. The assorted Interchange*.xsd files.  Click on the 'Interchange Schema Examples with
      Data' link on the website.  The files are located in separate folders within that
      archive.  Each of these files has a windows-style relative path to 'Ed-Fi-Core.xsd'
      that needs to be updated to reflect that they are in the same folder as that file.

Refer to the CSV2XML documentation for more information.
