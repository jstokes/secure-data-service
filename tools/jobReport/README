Job Report Tool

This tool consists of two components:
API Server: node.js http server that serves as an interface to one or many mongodb ingestion_batch_job databases.
GUI: HTML and javascript that queries the API and aggregates/displays reports.

Setup:
System must have node.js and npm installed.
The API server requires two node modules that must be downloaded with npm: mongoose, restify.  Simply run "sh install_dependencies.sh" to install.

Run:
API server
  as a developer, simply execute "node server.js"
  on a server, execute "nohup node server.js 2>&1 > jobreport_server.log &"

GUI
  The html file does not need to be served by a web server, it can be run directly from the file system.
  If you do want to serve from Tomcat, copy the contents of jobReport/gui to a new directory in your tomcat /webapps/ directory.
