To generate student assessment associations, run
(gen-saas student-ids assessment-id n output-file)
where student-ids is the same list of ids, assessment-id is the assessment identification code of the assessment you are using, n is the number of times each student takes the assessment, and output-file is the file name where you want the ed-fi written to

To generate school enrollments, run
