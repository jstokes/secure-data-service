# genAssessments

Generate assessment data for aggregation testing.

Requirements:
- clojure

Loading:
- Start repl by invoking 'lein repl'
- call (load-file "src/genAssessments/core.clj")
- call (refer 'genAssessments.core)


To generate student ed-fi, run
(gen-students student-ids output-file)
where student-ids is a list of ids (can be generated using (range n), where n is the number of students you want) and output-file is the file name where you want the ed-fi written to

To generate student assessment associations, run
(gen-saas student-ids assessment-id n output-file)
where student-ids is the same list of ids, assessment-id is the assessment identification code of the assessment you are using, n is the number of times each student takes the assessment, and output-file is the file name where you want the ed-fi written to

To generate school enrollments, run
(gen-enrollments student-ids school output-file)
where student ids is the same list of ids, school is the StateOrganizationId of the school/ed-org, and output-file is the file name where you want the ed-fi written to

To generate section enrollments, run
(gen-section-enrollments student-ids school section output-file)
with the same arguments as the school enrollments, but with section equal to the UniqueSectionCode of the section

The following commands will generate data with 350 students and 10 assessments each that can be used with the IL Daybreak InterchangeAssessmentMetadata-StateAssessments.xml, InterchangeEducationOrganization.xml, InterchangeEducationOrgCalendar.xml, and InterchangeMasterSchedule.xml
(def students (range 350))
  (gen-students students "data/students.xml")
  (gen-saas students "Grade 7 2011 State Math" 10 "data/assessment-results.xml")
  (gen-enrollments students "East Daybreak Junior High" "data/enrollment.xml")
  (gen-section-enrollments students "East Daybreak Junior High" "7th Grade Math - Sec 2" "data/sections.xml"))

Note this is not intended to be a general purpose data generation tool.  It makes a number of assumptions about what the data should look like (for instance, the assessment reporting code is assumed to be "Test Contractor") and make not work with other sets of data.
